### Dataset Summary

> Human evaluation results and translation output for the Translator Human Parity Data release,
> as described in https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/machine-translation-news-test-set-human-parity/ 
 
> The Translator Human Parity Data release contains all human evaluation results and translations
> related to our paper "Achieving Human Parity on Automatic Chinese to English News Translation",
> published on March 14, 2018. We have released this data to 

> 1) allow external validation of our claim of having achieved human parity
> 2) to foster future research by releasing two additional human references 
>   for the Reference-WMT test set. 
>

The dataset includes:

1) two new references for Chinese-English language pair of WMT17, 
   one based on human translation from scratch (Reference-HT),
   the other based on human post-editing (Reference-PE); 

2) human parity translations generated by our research systems Combo-4, Combo-5, and Combo-6, 
   as well as translation output from online machine translation service Online-A-1710,
   collected on October 16, 2017;

The data package provided with the study also includes (but not parsed and provided as 
workable features of this dataset) all data points collected in human evaluation campaigns.

### Data Fields

As mentioned in the summary, this dataset provides 6 extra English translations of 
Chinese-English language pair of WMT17.

Data fields are named exactly like the associated paper for easier cross-referenceing.

- `Reference-HT`: human translation from scrach.
- `Reference-PE`: human post-editing.
- `Combo-4`, `Combo-5`, `Combo-6`: three translations by research systems.
- `Online-A-1710`: a translation from an anonymous online machine translation service.

All data fields of a record are translations for the same Chinese source sentence.
