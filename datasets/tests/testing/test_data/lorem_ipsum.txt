But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which
of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
that produces no resultant pleasure?

At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis
praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias
excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui
officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem
rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis
est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere
possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus
autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet
ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum
rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores
alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being
able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
