### Dataset Summary

LibriSpeech is a corpus of approximately 1000 hours of 16kHz read English speech, prepared by Vassil Panayotov with the assistance of Daniel Povey. The data is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox project, and has been carefully segmented and aligned.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`, `audio-speaker-identification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to transcribe the audio file to written text. The most common evaluation metric is the word error rate (WER). The task has an active Hugging Face leaderboard which can be found at https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/hf-speech-bench. The leaderboard ranks models uploaded to the Hub based on their WER. An external leaderboard at https://paperswithcode.com/sota/speech-recognition-on-librispeech-test-clean ranks the latest models from research and academia.

### Languages

The audio is in English. There are two configurations: `clean` and `other`. 
The speakers in the corpus were ranked according to the WER of the transcripts of a model trained on
a different dataset, and were divided roughly in the middle,
with the lower-WER speakers designated as "clean" and the higher WER speakers designated as "other".

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises the path to the audio file, usually called `file` and its transcription, called `text`. Some additional information about the speaker and the passage which contains the transcription is provided.

```


### Data Fields

- file: A path to the downloaded audio file in .flac format.

- audio: A dictionary containing the path to the downloaded audio file, the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"audio"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["audio"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`.

- text: the transcription of the audio file.

- id: unique id of the data sample.

- speaker_id: unique id of the speaker. The same speaker id can be found for multiple data samples.

- chapter_id: id of the audiobook chapter which includes the transcription.

### Data Splits

The size of the corpus makes it impractical, or at least inconvenient
for some users, to distribute it as a single large archive. Thus the
training portion of the corpus is split into three subsets, with approximate size 100, 360 and 500 hours respectively.
A simple automatic
procedure was used to select the audio in the first two sets to be, on
average, of higher recording quality and with accents closer to US
English. An acoustic model was trained on WSJâ€™s si-84 data subset
and was used to recognize the audio in the corpus, using a bigram
LM estimated on the text of the respective books. We computed the
Word Error Rate (WER) of this automatic transcript relative to our
reference transcripts obtained from the book texts.
The speakers in the corpus were ranked according to the WER of
the WSJ modelâ€™s transcripts, and were divided roughly in the middle,
with the lower-WER speakers designated as "clean" and the higher-WER speakers designated as "other".

For "clean", the data is split into train, validation, and test set. The train set is further split into train.100 and train.360
respectively accounting for 100h and 360h of the training data. 
For "other", the data is split into train, validation, and test set. The train set contains approximately 500h of recorded speech.

| clean | - | 104014 | 28539 |  2703 | 2620|
| other | 148688 | - | - | 2864 | 2939 |
