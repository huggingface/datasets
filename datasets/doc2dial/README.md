### Data Fields

For `document_domain`,

- `doc_id`: the ID of a document;
- `title`: the title of the document;
- `domain`: the domain of the document;
- `doc_text`: the text content of the document (without HTML markups);
- `doc_html_ts`: the document content with HTML markups and the annotated spans that are indicated by `text_id` attribute, which corresponds to `id_sp`.
- `doc_html_raw`: the document content with HTML markups and without span annotations.
- `spans`: key-value pairs of all spans in the document, with `id_sp` as key. Each span includes the following,
  - `id_sp`: the id of a  span as noted by `text_id` in  `doc_html_ts`;
  - `start_sp`/  `end_sp`: the start/end position of the text span in `doc_text`;
  - `text_sp`: the text content of the span.
  - `id_sec`: the id of the (sub)section (e.g. `<p>`) or title (`<h2>`) that contains the span.
  - `start_sec` / `end_sec`: the start/end position of the (sub)section in `doc_text`.
  - `text_sec`: the text of the (sub)section.
  - `title`: the title of the (sub)section.
  - `parent_titles`: the parent titles of the `title`.



For `dialogue_domain`:

- `dial_id`: the ID of a dialogue;
- `doc_id`: the ID of the associated document;
- `domain`: domain of the document;
- `turns`: a list of dialogue turns. Each turn includes,
  - `turn_id`: the time order of the turn;
  - `role`: either "agent" or "user";
  - `da`: dialogue act;
  - `references`: the grounding span (`id_sp`) in the associated document. If a turn is an irrelevant turn, i.e., `da` ends with "ood", `reference` is empty.  **Note** that spans with labels "*precondition*"/"*solution*" are the actual grounding spans. Spans with label "*reference*" are the related titles or contextual reference,  which is used for the purpose of describing a dialogue scene better to crowd contributors.
  - `utterance`: the human-generated utterance based on the dialogue scene.



For `doc2dial_rc`, this conforms to [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) data format. For how to load Doc2Dial data for reading comprehension task, please refer [here](https://github.com/doc2dial/sharedtask-dialdoc2021).

- `id`: the ID of a QA instance;
