### [Dataset Summary](#dataset-summary)

Cosmos QA is a large-scale dataset of 35.6K problems that require commonsense-based reading comprehension, formulated as multiple-choice questions. It focuses on reading between the lines over a diverse collection of people's everyday narratives, asking questions concerning on the likely causes or effects of events that require reasoning beyond the exact text spans in the context
