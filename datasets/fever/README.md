### Dataset Summary

With billions of individual pages on the web providing information on almost every conceivable topic, we should have the ability to collect facts that answer almost every conceivable question. However, only a small fraction of this information is contained in structured sources (Wikidata, Freebase, etc.) – we are therefore limited by our ability to transform free-form text to structured knowledge. There is, however, another problem that has become the focus of a lot of recent research and media coverage: false information coming from unreliable sources. [1] [2]

The FEVER workshops are a venue for work in verifiable knowledge extraction and to stimulate progress in this direction.

It consists of claims generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia and subsequently verified without knowledge of the sentence they were derived from. The claims are classified as SUPPORTED, REFUTED or NOTENOUGHINFO by annotators.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The task is verification of textual claims against textual sources.

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language inference, the key difference is that in these tasks the passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in verification systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence.

### Languages

The dataset is in English.
