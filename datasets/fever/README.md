### Dataset Summary

With billions of individual pages on the web providing information on almost every conceivable topic, we should have
the ability to collect facts that answer almost every conceivable question. However, only a small fraction of this
information is contained in structured sources (Wikidata, Freebase, etc.) – we are therefore limited by our ability to
transform free-form text to structured knowledge. There is, however, another problem that has become the focus of a lot
of recent research and media coverage: false information coming from unreliable sources.

The FEVER workshops are a venue for work in verifiable knowledge extraction and to stimulate progress in this direction.

- FEVER Dataset: FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) consists of 185,445 claims generated by altering sentences
extracted from Wikipedia and subsequently verified without knowledge of the sentence they were derived from. The claims
are classified as Supported, Refuted or NotEnoughInfo. For the first two classes, the annotators also recorded the
sentence(s) forming the necessary evidence for their judgment.

- FEVER 2.0 Adversarial Attacks Dataset: The FEVER 2.0 Dataset consists of 1174 claims created by the submissions of
participants in the Breaker phase of the 2019 shared task. Participants (Breakers) were tasked with generating
adversarial examples that induce classification errors for the existing systems. Breakers submitted a dataset of up to
1000 instances with equal number of instances for each of the three classes (Supported, Refuted NotEnoughInfo). Only
novel claims (i.e. not contained in the original FEVER dataset) were considered as valid entries to the shared task.
The submissions were then manually evaluated for Correctness (grammatical, appropriately labeled and meet the FEVER
annotation guidelines requirements).

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The task is verification of textual claims against textual sources.

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language inference, the key difference is that in these tasks the
passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in
verification systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence.

### Languages

The dataset is in English.
