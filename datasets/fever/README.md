### Dataset Summary

With billions of individual pages on the web providing information on almost every conceivable topic, we should have
the ability to collect facts that answer almost every conceivable question. However, only a small fraction of this
information is contained in structured sources (Wikidata, Freebase, etc.) – we are therefore limited by our ability to
transform free-form text to structured knowledge. There is, however, another problem that has become the focus of a lot
of recent research and media coverage: false information coming from unreliable sources.

The FEVER workshops are a venue for work in verifiable knowledge extraction and to stimulate progress in this direction.

- FEVER Dataset: FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification) consists of 185,445 claims generated by altering sentences
extracted from Wikipedia and subsequently verified without knowledge of the sentence they were derived from. The claims
are classified as Supported, Refuted or NotEnoughInfo. For the first two classes, the annotators also recorded the
sentence(s) forming the necessary evidence for their judgment.

- FEVER 2.0 Adversarial Attacks Dataset: The FEVER 2.0 Dataset consists of 1174 claims created by the submissions of
participants in the Breaker phase of the 2019 shared task. Participants (Breakers) were tasked with generating
adversarial examples that induce classification errors for the existing systems. Breakers submitted a dataset of up to
1000 instances with equal number of instances for each of the three classes (Supported, Refuted NotEnoughInfo). Only
novel claims (i.e. not contained in the original FEVER dataset) were considered as valid entries to the shared task.
The submissions were then manually evaluated for Correctness (grammatical, appropriately labeled and meet the FEVER
annotation guidelines requirements).

- FEVEROUS: FEVEROUS (Fact Extraction and VERification Over Unstructured and Structured information) is a fact
verification dataset which consists of 87,026 verified claims. Each claim is annotated with evidence in the form of
sentences and/or cells from tables in Wikipedia, as well as a label indicating whether this evidence supports, refutes,
or does not provide enough information to reach a verdict. The dataset also contains annotation metadata such as
annotator actions (query keywords, clicks on page, time signatures), and the type of challenge each claim poses.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The task is verification of textual claims against textual sources.

When compared to textual entailment (TE)/natural language inference, the key difference is that in these tasks the
passage to verify each claim is given, and in recent years it typically consists a single sentence, while in
verification systems it is retrieved from a large set of documents in order to form the evidence.

### Languages

The dataset is in English.

#### feverous

- `id` (int): ID of the sample.
- `label` (ClassLabel): Annotated label for the claim. Can be one of {"SUPPORTS", "REFUTES", "NOT ENOUGH INFO"}.
- `claim` (str): Text of the claim.
- `evidence` (list of dict): Evidence sets (at maximum three). Each set consists of dictionaries with two fields:
  - `content` (list of str): List of element IDs serving as the evidence for the claim. Each element ID is in the format
      `"[PAGE ID]_[EVIDENCE TYPE]_[NUMBER ID]"`, where `[EVIDENCE TYPE]` can be: `sentence`, `cell`, `header_cell`,
      `table_caption`, `item`.
  - `context` (list of list of str): List (for each element ID in `content`) of a list of Wikipedia elements that are
      automatically associated with that element ID and serve as context. This includes an article's title, relevant
      sections (the section and sub-section(s) the element is located in), and for cells the closest row and column
      header (multiple row/column headers if they follow each other).
- `annotator_operations` (list of dict): List of operations an annotator used to find the evidence and reach a verdict,
    given the claim. Each element in the list is a dictionary with the fields:
  - `operation` (str): Operation name. Any of the following:
    - `start`, `finish`: Annotation started/finished. The value is the name of the operation.
    - `search`: Annotator used the Wikipedia search function. The value is the entered search term or the term selected
        from the automatic suggestions. If the annotator did not select any of the suggestions but instead went into
        advanced search, the term is prefixed with "contains...".
    - `hyperlink`: Annotator clicked on a hyperlink in the page. The value is the anchor text of the hyperlink.
    - `Now on`: The page the annotator has landed after a search or a hyperlink click. The value is the PAGE ID.
    - `Page search`: Annotator search on a page. The value is the search term.
    - `page-search-reset`: Annotator cleared the search box. The value is the name of the operation.
    - `Highlighting`, `Highlighting deleted`: Annotator selected/unselected an element on the page. The value is
        `ELEMENT ID`.
    - `back-button-clicked`: Annotator pressed the back button. The value is the name of the operation.
  - `value` (str): Value associated with the operation.
  - `time` (float): Time in seconds from the start of the annotation.
- `expected_challenge` (str): The challenge the claim generator selected will be faced when verifying the claim, one
    out of the following: `Numerical Reasoning`, `Multi-hop Reasoning`, `Entity Disambiguation`,
    `Combining Tables and Text`, `Search terms not in claim`, `Other`.
- `challenge` (str): Main challenge to verify the claim, one out of the following: `Numerical Reasoning`,
    `Multi-hop Reasoning`, `Entity Disambiguation`, `Combining Tables and Text`, `Search terms not in claim`, `Other`.
