### Contributions

[researcher2](https://github.com/researcher2) Wrote much of this code, with inspiration and some straight copying of the scraping code found [here](https://github.com/yet-another-account/openwebtext/).<br/>
[sdtblck](https://github.com/sdtblck/) kindly put together the Colab notebook, and performed a chunk of the scraping. <br/>
[leogao2](https://github.com/leogao2/) provided overall design guidance, lm_dataformat, and performed another chunk of scraping. <br />
[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) VMs helped with about 10% of our overall scraping. <br />
[The Eye](http://the-eye.eu/) host the processed datasets.<br />
