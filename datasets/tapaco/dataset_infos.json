Tatoeba is a\ncrowdsourcing project mainly geared towards language learners. Its aim is to provide example sentences and translations for particular\nlinguistic constructions and words. The paraphrase corpus is created by populating a graph with Tatoeba sentences and equivalence links\nbetween sentences \u201cmeaning the same thing\u201d. This graph is then traversed to extract sets of paraphrases. Several language-independent\nfilters and pruning steps are applied to remove uninteresting sentences. A manual evaluation performed on three languages shows\nthat between half and three quarters of inferred paraphrases are correct and that most remaining ones are either correct but trivial, or\nnear-paraphrases that neutralize a morphological distinction.
