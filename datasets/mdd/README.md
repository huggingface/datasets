### Dataset Summary

The Movie Dialog dataset (MDD) is designed to measure how well models can perform at goal and non-goal orientated dialog centered around the topic of movies (question answering, recommendation and discussion), from various movie reviews sources such as MovieLens and OMDb.
### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[More Information Needed]

### Languages

The data is present in English language as written by users on OMDb and MovieLens websites.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances
An instance from the `task3_qarecs` config's `train` split:
```
{'dialogue_turns': {'speaker': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 'utterance': ["I really like Jaws, Bottle Rocket, Saving Private Ryan, Tommy Boy, The Muppet Movie, Face/Off, and Cool Hand Luke. I'm looking for a Documentary movie.", 'Beyond the Mat', 'Who is that directed by?', 'Barry W. Blaustein', 'I like Jon Fauer movies more. Do you know anything else?', 'Cinematographer Style']}}
```
An instance from the `task4_reddit` config's `cand-valid` split:
```
{'dialogue_turns': {'speaker': [0], 'utterance': ['MORTAL KOMBAT !']}}
```
### Data Fields

For all configurations:
- `dialogue_turns`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `speaker`: an integer with possible values including `0`, `1`, indicating which speaker wrote the utterance.
  - `utterance`: a `string` feature containing the text utterance.

### Data Splits

The splits and corresponding sizes are:

|config  |train  |test |validation|cand_valid|cand_test|
|:--|------:|----:|---------:|----:|----:|
|task1_qa|96185|9952|9968|-|-|
|task2_recs|1000000|10000|10000|-|-|
|task3_qarecs|952125|4915|5052|-|-|
|task4_reddit|945198|10000|10000|10000|10000|

The `cand_valid` and `cand_test` are negative candidates for the `task4_reddit` configuration which is used in ranking true positive against these candidates and hits@k (or another ranking metric) is reported. (See paper)


## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The construction of the tasks depended on some existing datasets:

1) MovieLens. The data was downloaded from: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/ on May 27th, 2015.

2) OMDB. The data was downloaded from: http://beforethecode.com/projects/omdb/download.aspx on May 28th, 2015.

3) For `task4_reddit`, the data is a processed subset (movie subreddit only) of the data available at:
https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7

#### Who are the source language producers?

Users on MovieLens, OMDB website and reddit websites, among others.
