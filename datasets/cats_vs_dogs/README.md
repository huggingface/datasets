### Dataset Summary

A large set of images of cats and dogs. There are 1738 corrupted images that are dropped.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `image-classification`: The goal of this task is to classify a given image as either containing a cat or a dog. The leaderboard is available [here](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cats-vs-dogs).

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A sample from the training set is provided below:

```
{
  'image_file_path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/6e1e8c9052e9f3f7ecbcb4b90860668f81c1d36d86cc9606d49066f8da8bfb4f/PetImages/Cat/1.jpg',
  'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x375 at 0x29CEAD71780>,
  'label': 0
}
```

### Data Fields

The data instances have the following fields:

- `image_file_path`: a `string` filepath to an image.
- `image`: A `PIL.Image.Image` object containing the image. Note that when accessing the image column: `dataset[0]["image"]` the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"image"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["image"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["image"][0]`.
- `labels`: an `int` classification label.

Class Label Mappings:

```
{
  "cat": 0,
  "dog": 1,
}
```
