## Dataset Structure
 
### Data Instances

Here is an example from the dataset:
 
```
{'Parses': {'Answers': [{'AnswersMid': ['m.01npcx'], 'AnswersName': [['goldeneye']]}, {'AnswersMid': ['m.01npcx'], 'AnswersName': [['goldeneye']]}], 'InferentialChain': ['film.film_character.portrayed_in_films..film.performance.film', 'film.actor.film..film.performance.film'], 'Parse-Id': ['FreebaseQA-train-0.P0', 'FreebaseQA-train-0.P1'], 'PotentialTopicEntityMention': ['007', 'pierce brosnan'], 'TopicEntityMid': ['m.0clpml', 'm.018p4y'], 'TopicEntityName': ['james bond', 'pierce brosnan']}, 'ProcessedQuestion': "what was pierce brosnan's first outing as 007", 'Question-ID': 'FreebaseQA-train-0', 'RawQuestion': "What was Pierce Brosnan's first outing as 007?"}
```
 
### Data Fields
- `Question-ID`: a `string` feature representing ID of each question.
- `RawQuestion`: a `string` feature representing the original question collected from data sources.
- `ProcessedQuestion`: a `string` feature representing the question processed with some operations such as removal of trailing question mark and decapitalization.
- `Parses`: a dictionary feature representing the semantic parse(s) for the question containing:
  - `Parse-Id`: a `string` feature representing the ID of each semantic parse.
  - `PotentialTopicEntityMention`: a `string` feature representing the potential topic entity mention in the question.
  - `TopicEntityName`: a `string` feature representing name or alias of the topic entity in the question from Freebase.
  - `TopicEntityMid`: a `string` feature representing the Freebase MID of the topic entity in the question.
  - `InferentialChain`: a `string` feature representing path from the topic entity node to the answer node in Freebase, labeled as a predicate.
  - `Answers`: a dictionary feature representing the answer found from this parse containing:
    - `AnswersMid`: a `string` feature representing the Freebase MID of the answer.
    - `AnswersName`: a `list` of `string` features representing the answer string from the original question-answer pair.
### Data Splits
This data set contains 28,348 unique questions that are divided into three subsets: train (20,358), dev (3,994) and eval (3,996), formatted as JSON files: FreebaseQA-[train|dev|eval].json
## Dataset Creation
 
### Curation Rationale
 
[More Information Needed]
 
### Source Data
 
#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization
 
The data set is generated by matching trivia-type question-answer pairs with subject-predicateobject triples in Freebase. For each collected question-answer pair, we first tag all entities in each question and search for relevant predicates that bridge a tagged entity with the answer in Freebase. Finally, human annotation is used to remove false positives in these matched triples.

    abstract = "In this paper, we present a new data set, named FreebaseQA, for open-domain factoid question answering (QA) tasks over structured knowledge bases, like Freebase. The data set is generated by matching trivia-type question-answer pairs with subject-predicate-object triples in Freebase. For each collected question-answer pair, we first tag all entities in each question and search for relevant predicates that bridge a tagged entity with the answer in Freebase. Finally, human annotation is used to remove any false positive in these matched triples. Using this method, we are able to efficiently generate over 54K matches from about 28K unique questions with minimal cost. Our analysis shows that this data set is suitable for model training in factoid QA tasks beyond simpler questions since FreebaseQA provides more linguistically sophisticated questions than other existing data sets.",
