### Dataset Summary

The Amazon reviews dataset consists of reviews from amazon.
The data span a period of 18 years, including ~35 million reviews up to March 2013.
Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `text-classification`, `sentiment-classification`: The dataset is mainly used for text classification: given the content and the title, predict the correct star rating. 

### Languages

Mainly English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point, comprises of a title, a content and the corresponding label. 

An example from the AmazonPolarity test set looks as follows:

```
{
    'title':'Great CD',
    'content':"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?""",
    'label':1
}
```

### Data Fields

- 'title': a string containing the title of the review - escaped using double quotes (") and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is "\n".
- 'content': a string containing the body of the document - escaped using double quotes (") and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is "\n".
- 'label': either 1 (positive) or 0 (negative) rating.

### Data Splits

The Amazon reviews polarity dataset is constructed by taking review score 1 and 2 as negative, and 4 and 5 as positive. Samples of score 3 is ignored. Each class has 1,800,000 training samples and 200,000 testing samples.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The Amazon reviews polarity dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu). It is used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).
