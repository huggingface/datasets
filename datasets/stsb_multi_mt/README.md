### Dataset Summary

> STS Benchmark comprises a selection of the English datasets used in the STS tasks organized
> in the context of SemEval between 2012 and 2017. The selection of datasets include text from
> image captions, news headlines and user forums. ([source](https://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark))

These are different multilingual translations and the English original of the [STSbenchmark dataset](https://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark). Translation has been done with [deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/). It can be used to train [sentence embeddings](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) like [T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer](https://huggingface.co/T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer).


**Examples of Use**

Load German dev Dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("stsb_multi_mt", name="de", split="dev")
```

Load English train Dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("stsb_multi_mt", name="en", split="train")
```

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

This dataset provides pairs of sentences and a score of their similarity.

score | 2 example sentences | explanation
------|---------|------------
5 | *The bird is bathing in the sink.<br/>Birdie is washing itself in the water basin.* | The two sentences are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing.
4 | *Two boys on a couch are playing video games.<br/>Two boys are playing a video game.* | The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ.
3 | *John said he is considered a witness but not a suspect.<br/>“He is not a suspect anymore.” John said.* | The two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs/missing.
2 | *They flew out of the nest in groups.<br/>They flew into the nest together.* | The two sentences are not equivalent, but share some details.
1 | *The woman is playing the violin.<br/>The young lady enjoys listening to the guitar.* | The two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the same topic.
0 | *The black dog is running through the snow.<br/>A race car driver is driving his car through the mud.* | The two sentences are completely dissimilar.

An example:
```
{
    "sentence1": "A man is playing a large flute.",
    "sentence2": "A man is playing a flute.",
    "similarity_score": 3.8
}
```

### Data Fields

- `sentence1`: The 1st sentence as a `str`.
- `sentence2`: The 2nd sentence as a `str`.
- `similarity_score`: The similarity score as a `float` which is `<= 5.0` and `>= 0.0`.

### Data Splits

- train with 5749 samples
- dev with 1500 samples
- test with 1379 sampples
