### Dataset Summary

The Structured Argument Extraction for Korean dataset is a set of question-argument and command-argument pairs with their respective question type label and negativeness label. Often times, agents like Alexa or Siri, encounter conversations without a clear objective from the user. The goal of this dataset is to extract the intent argument of a given utterance pair without a clear directive. This may yield a more robust agent capable of parsing more non-canonical forms of speech.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

* `intent_classification`: The dataset can be trained with a Transformer like [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) to classify the intent argument or a question/command pair in Korean, and it's performance can be measured by it's BERTScore. 

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in Korean and the associated is BCP-47 code is `ko-KR`.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example data instance contains a question or command pair and its label:

```
{
  "intent_pair1": "내일 오후 다섯시 조별과제 일정 추가해줘"
  "intent_pair2": "내일 오후 다섯시 조별과제 일정 추가하기"
  "label": 4
}
```

### Data Fields

* `intent_pair1`: a question/command pair
* `intent_pair2`: a corresponding question/command pair
* `label`: determines the intent argument of the pair and can be one of `yes/no` (0), `alternative` (1), `wh- questions` (2), `prohibitions` (3), `requirements` (4) and `strong requirements` (5)

### Data Splits

The corpus contains 30,837 examples.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The Structured Argument Extraction for Korean dataset was curated to help train models extract intent arguments from utterances without a clear objective or when the user uses non-canonical forms of speech. This is especially helpful in Korean because in English, the `Who, what, where, when and why` usually comes in the beginning, but this isn't necessarily the case in the Korean language. So for low-resource languages, this lack of data can be a bottleneck for comprehension performance.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The corpus was taken from the one constructed by [Cho et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04231), a Korean single utterance corpus for identifying directives/non-directives that contains a wide variety of non-canonical directives. 

#### Who are the source language producers?

Korean speakers are the source language producers.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Utterances were categorized as question or command arguments and then further classified according to their intent argument.

#### Who are the annotators?

The annotation was done by three Korean natives with a background in computational linguistics.
