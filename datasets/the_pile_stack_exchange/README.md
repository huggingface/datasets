However, the previous question doesn't have a good answer (or is unanswered). In this case, is it better to ask the questi\non again in a new post (which might be marked as duplicate) or comment on the old post (which might be several years old)? In other words, wha\nt are the customs of this site in regards to reviving old questions/discussions?\n\nA:\n\nAs Martin commented, it really depends on the type of question. In any case, you always have the following possibilities:\n\nAsk a new question\nEdit the question to bump it to the first page\nAdd a bounty\nBring it to the attention of people in chat\n\nConsider the following cases:\n\nI have exactly the same question as asked and unanswered before!\n\nIf you ask a new question which turns out to be the same question, it may be closed as a dupe (depending on whether users remember the old que\nstion). Not the ideal option.\nIf you can find something substantial to edit and bump the question, do so. Maybe add a comment that you would really love an answer.\nIf you can spare some rep for a bounty (50 is usually enough), do so.\nYou can always bring it to the attention of people in chat.\n",}
