### Dataset Summary

The data came from the GENIA version 3.02 corpus (Kim et al., 2003). This was formed from a controlled search on MEDLINE using the MeSH terms human, blood cells and transcription factors. From this search 2,000 abstracts were selected and hand annotated according to a small taxonomy of 48 classes based on a chemical classification. Among the classes, 36 terminal classes were used to annotate the GENIA corpus.
