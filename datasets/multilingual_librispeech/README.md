## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** [MultiLingual LibriSpeech ASR corpus](http://www.openslr.org/94)
- **Repository:** [Needs More Information]
- **Paper:** [MLS: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03411)
- **Leaderboard:** [Paperswithcode Leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/multilingual-librispeech)

### Dataset Summary

Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) dataset is a large multilingual corpus suitable for speech research. The dataset is derived from read audiobooks from LibriVox and consists of 8 languages - English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`, `audio-speaker-identification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to transcribe the audio file to written text. The most common evaluation metric is the word error rate (WER). The task has an active leaderboard which can be found at https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/multilingual-librispeech and ranks models based on their WER.

### Languages

The dataset is derived from read audiobooks from LibriVox and consists of 8 languages - English, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Polish

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises the path to the audio file, usually called `file` and its transcription, called `text`. Some additional information about the speaker and the passage which contains the transcription is provided.

```


### Data Fields

- file: A path to the downloaded audio file in .flac format.

- audio: A dictionary containing the path to the downloaded audio file, the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"audio"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["audio"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`.

- text: the transcription of the audio file.

- id: unique id of the data sample.

- speaker_id: unique id of the speaker. The same speaker id can be found for multiple data samples.

- chapter_id: id of the audiobook chapter which includes the transcription.
