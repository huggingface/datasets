### Dataset Summary

Multi-Domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset (MultiWOZ), a fully-labeled collection of human-human written conversations spanning over multiple domains and topics.
MultiWOZ 2.1 (Eric et al., 2019) identified and fixed many erroneous annotations and user utterances in the original version, resulting in an
improved version of the dataset. MultiWOZ 2.2 is a yet another improved version of this dataset, which identifies and fixes dialogue state annotation errors
across 17.3% of the utterances on top of MultiWOZ 2.1 and redefines the ontology by disallowing vocabularies of slots with a large number of possible values
(e.g., restaurant name, time of booking) and introducing standardized slot span annotations for these slots.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

This dataset supports a range of task.
- **Generative dialogue modeling** or `dialogue-modeling`: the text of the dialogues can be used to train a sequence model on the utterances. Performance on this task is typically evaluated with delexicalized-[BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu), inform rate and request success.
- **Intent state tracking**, a `multi-class-classification` task: predict the belief state of the user side of the conversation, performance is measured by [F1](https://huggingface.co/metrics/f1).
- **Dialog act prediction**, a `parsing` task: parse an utterance into the corresponding dialog acts for the system to use. [F1](https://huggingface.co/metrics/f1) is typically reported.

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in English (`en`).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A data instance is a full multi-turn dialogue between a `USER` and a `SYSTEM`. Each turn has a single utterance, e.g.:
```
['What fun places can I visit in the East?',
 'We have five spots which include boating, museums and entertainment. Any preferences that you have?']
```
The utterances of the `USER` are also annotated with frames denoting their intent and believe state:
```
[{'service': ['attraction'],
  'slots': [{'copy_from': [],
    'copy_from_value': [],
    'exclusive_end': [],
    'slot': [],
    'start': [],
    'value': []}],
  'state': [{'active_intent': 'find_attraction',
    'requested_slots': [],
    'slots_values': {'slots_values_list': [['east']],
     'slots_values_name': ['attraction-area']}}]},
 {'service': [], 'slots': [], 'state': []}]
```
Finally, each of the utterances is annotated with dialog acts which provide a structured representation of what the `USER` or `SYSTEM` is inquiring or giving information about.
```
[{'dialog_act': {'act_slots': [{'slot_name': ['east'],
     'slot_value': ['area']}],
   'act_type': ['Attraction-Inform']},
  'span_info': {'act_slot_name': ['area'],
   'act_slot_value': ['east'],
   'act_type': ['Attraction-Inform'],
   'span_end': [39],
   'span_start': [35]}},
 {'dialog_act': {'act_slots': [{'slot_name': ['none'], 'slot_value': ['none']},
    {'slot_name': ['boating', 'museums', 'entertainment', 'five'],
     'slot_value': ['type', 'type', 'type', 'choice']}],
   'act_type': ['Attraction-Select', 'Attraction-Inform']},
  'span_info': {'act_slot_name': ['type', 'type', 'type', 'choice'],
   'act_slot_value': ['boating', 'museums', 'entertainment', 'five'],
   'act_type': ['Attraction-Inform',
    'Attraction-Inform',
    'Attraction-Inform',
    'Attraction-Inform'],
   'span_end': [40, 49, 67, 12],
   'span_start': [33, 42, 54, 8]}}]
```

### Data Fields

Each dialogue instance has the following fields:
- `dialogue_id`: a unique ID identifying the dialog. The MUL and PMUL names refer to strictly multi domain dialogues (at least 2 main domains are involved) while the SNG, SSNG and WOZ names refer to single domain dialogues with potentially sub-domains like booking.
- `services`: a list of services mentioned in the dialog, such as `train` or `hospitals`.
- `turns`: the sequence of utterances with their annotations, including:
  - `turn_id`: a turn identifier, unique per dialog.
  - `speaker`: either the `USER` or `SYSTEM`.
  - `utterance`: the text of the utterance.
  - `dialogue_acts`: The structured parse of the utterance into dialog acts in the system's grammar
    - `act_type`: Such as e.g. `Attraction-Inform` to seek or provide information about an `attraction`
    - `act_slots`: provide more details about the action
    - `span_info`: maps these `act_slots` to the `utterance` text.
  - `frames`: only for `USER` utterances, track the user's belief state, i.e. a structured representation of what they are trying to achieve in the fialog. This decomposes into:
    - `service`: the service they are interested in
    - `state`: their belief state including their `active_intent` and further information expressed in `requested_slots`
    - `slots`: a mapping of the `requested_slots` to where they are mentioned in the text. It takes one of two forms, detailed next:
The first type are span annotations that identify the location where slot values have been mentioned in the utterances for non-categorical slots. These span annotations are represented as follows:
```
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot": String of slot name.
      "start": Int denoting the index of the starting character in the utterance corresponding to the slot value.
      "exclusive_end": Int denoting the index of the character just after the last character corresponding to the slot value in the utterance. In python, utterance[start:exclusive_end] gives the slot value.
      "value": String of value. It equals to utterance[start:exclusive_end], where utterance is the current utterance in string.
    }
  ]
}
```
There are also some non-categorical slots whose values are carried over from another slot in the dialogue state. Their values don"t explicitly appear in the utterances. For example, a user utterance can be "I also need a taxi from the restaurant to the hotel.", in which the state values of "taxi-departure" and "taxi-destination" are respectively carried over from that of "restaurant-name" and "hotel-name". For these slots, instead of annotating them as spans, a "copy from" annotation identifies the slot it copies the value from. This annotation is formatted as follows,
```
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot": Slot name string.
      "copy_from": The slot to copy from.
      "value": A list of slot values being . It corresponds to the state values of the "copy_from" slot.
    }
  ]
}
```

### Data Splits

The dataset is split into a `train`, `validation`, and `test` split with the following sizes:

|                            | Tain   | Valid | Test |
| -----                      | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| Number of dialogues        | 8438   | 1000  | 1000 |
| Number of turns            | 42190  | 5000  | 5000 |
