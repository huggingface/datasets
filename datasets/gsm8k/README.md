### Dataset Summary

GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) is a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems. The dataset was created to support the task of question answering on basic mathematical problems that require multi-step reasoning.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[Needs More Information]

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in English. The associated BCP-47 code is `en`.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

For the `main` configuration, each instance contains a string for the grade-school level math question and a string for the corresponding answer with multiple steps of reasoning and calculator annotations (explained [here](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math#calculation-annotations)).


```python
{
    'question': 'Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?',
    'answer': 'Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72',
}
```

For the `socratic` configuration, each instance contains a string for a grade-school level math question, a string for the corresponding answer with multiple steps of reasoning, calculator annotations (explained [here](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math#calculation-annotations)), and *Socratic sub-questions*.

```python
{
    'question': 'Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?',
    'answer': 'How many clips did Natalia sell in May? ** Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nHow many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May? ** Natalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72',
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among `main` and `socratic` configurations and their individual splits.

- question: The question string to a grade school math problem.

- answer: The full solution string to the `question`. It contains multiple steps of reasoning with calculator annotations and the final numeric solution.

### Data Splits

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[Needs More Information]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

From the paper:

> We initially collected a starting set of a thousand problems and natural language solutions by hiring freelance contractors on Upwork (upwork.com). We then worked with Surge AI (surgehq.ai), an NLP data labeling platform, to scale up our data collection. After collecting the full dataset, we asked workers to re-solve all problems, with no workers re-solving problems they originally wrote. We checked whether their final answers agreed with the original solu- tions, and any problems that produced disagreements were either repaired or discarded. We then performed another round of agreement checks on a smaller subset of problems, finding that 1.7% of problems still produce disagreements among contractors. We estimate this to be the fraction of problems that con- tain breaking errors or ambiguities. It is possible that a larger percentage of problems contain subtle errors.
