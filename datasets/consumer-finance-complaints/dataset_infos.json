{"default": {"description": "The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally updates daily.\nThere are multiple Text Classification problems that can be solved with this dataset:\n- Complaint Type Identification\n- Complaint Sub-Product Identification\n- Complaint from vulnerable or Service-person\n", "citation": "\n", "homepage": "https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/", "license":
