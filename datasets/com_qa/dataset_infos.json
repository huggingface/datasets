{"default": {"description": "ComQA is a dataset of 11,214 questions, which were collected from WikiAnswers, a community question answering website. \nBy collecting questions from such a site we ensure that the information needs are ones of interest to actual users. \nMoreover, questions posed there are often cannot be answered by commercial search engines or QA technology, making them \nmore interesting for driving future research compared to those collected from an engine's query log. The dataset contains \nquestions with various challenging phenomena such as the need for temporal reasoning, comparison (e.g., comparatives, \nsuperlatives, ordinals), compositionality (multiple, possibly nested, subquestions with multiple entities), and \nunanswerable questions (e.g., Who was the first human being on Mars?). Through a large crowdsourcing effort, questions \nin ComQA are grouped into 4,834 paraphrase clusters that express the same information need. Each cluster is annotated \nwith its answer(s). ComQA answers come in the form of Wikipedia entities wherever possible. Wherever the answers are \ntemporal or measurable quantities, TIMEX3 and the International System of Units (SI) are used for normalization.\n", "citation": "@inproceedings{abujabal-etal-2019-comqa,\n    title = \"{ComQA: A Community-sourced Dataset for Complex Factoid Question Answering with Paraphrase Clusters\",\n    author = {Abujabal, Abdalghani  and\n      Saha Roy, Rishiraj  and\n      Yahya, Mohamed  and\n      Weikum, Gerhard},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)},\n    month = {jun},\n    year = {2019},\n    address = {Minneapolis, Minnesota},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1027},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/N19-1027{,\n    pages = {307--317},\n    }\n", "homepage": "http://qa.mpi-inf.mpg.de/comqa/", "license": "", "features": {"cluster_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "questions": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "answers": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "com_qa", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "0.1.0", "description": null, "datasets_version_to_prepare": null, "major": 0, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 696645, "num_examples": 3966, "dataset_name": "com_qa"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 273384, "num_examples": 2243, "dataset_name": "com_qa"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 131945, "num_examples": 966, "dataset_name": "com_qa"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://qa.mpi-inf.mpg.de/comqa/comqa_train.json": {"num_bytes": 1054334, "checksum": "aa25b2747221a6147737066fa7f8509414a6333e6eebb20d7970fc50166eba9c"}, "https://qa.mpi-inf.mpg.de/comqa/comqa_dev.json": {"num_bytes": 213246, "checksum": "937f898f996e9a7317d311553cf5b43c4a53e0bb841ae8eed4d8cf15936fbc84"}, "https://qa.mpi-inf.mpg.de/comqa/comqa_test.json": {"num_bytes": 404104, "checksum": "b81e19c4108198781167ddb30d26172571e76cc8e684aabb181537a45e816867"}}, "download_size": 1671684, "dataset_size": 1101974, "size_in_bytes": 2773658}}
