_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Hindi Discourse Analysis dataset is a corpus for analyzing discourse modes present in its sentences.
It contains sentences from stories written by 11 famous authors from the 20th Century.
4-5 stories by each author have been selected which were available in the public domain resulting
in a collection of 53 stories. Most of these short stories were originally written in Hindi
but some of them were written in other Indian languages and later translated to Hindi.
