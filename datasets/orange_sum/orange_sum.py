_DESCRIPTION = """\
The OrangeSum dataset was inspired by the XSum dataset. It was created by scraping the "Orange Actu" website: https://actu.orange.fr/. Orange S.A. is a large French multinational telecommunications corporation, with 266M customers worldwide. Scraped pages cover almost a decade from Feb 2011 to Sep 2020. They belong to five main categories: France, world, politics, automotive, and society. The society category is itself divided into 8 subcategories: health, environment, people, culture, media, high-tech, unsual ("insolite" in French), and miscellaneous.

Each article featured a single-sentence title as well as a very brief abstract, both professionally written by the author of the article. These two fields were extracted from each page, thus creating two summarization tasks: OrangeSum Title and OrangeSum Abstract.
