## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openai/human-eval)
- **Paper:** [Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)

### Dataset Summary

The HumanEval dataset released by OpenAI includes 164 programming problems with a function sig- nature, docstring, body, and several unit tests. They were handwritten to ensure not to be included in the training set of code generation models.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

### Languages
The programming problems are written in Python and contain English natural text in comments and docstrings.

## Dataset Structure

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
load_dataset("openai_humaneval")

DatasetDict({
    test: Dataset({
        features: ['task_id', 'prompt', 'canonical_solution', 'test', 'entry_point'],
        num_rows: 164
    })
})
```

### Data Instances

An example of a dataset instance:

```
{
    "task_id": "test/0",
    "prompt": "def return1():\n",
    "canonical_solution": "    return 1",
    "test": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate() == 1",
    "entry_point": "return1"
}
```

### Data Fields

- `task_id`: identifier for the data sample
- `prompt`: input for the model containing function header and docstrings
- `canonical_solution`: solution for the problem in the `prompt`
- `test`: contains function to test generated code for correctness
- `entry_point`: entry point for test


### Data Splits

The dataset only consists of a test split with 164 samples.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Since code generation models are often trained on dumps of GitHub a dataset not included in the dump was necessary to properly evaluate the model. However, since this dataset was published on GitHub it is likely to be included in future dumps.

### Source Data

The dataset was handcrafted by engineers and researchers at OpenAI.

## Considerations for Using the Data
Make sure you execute generated Python code in a safe environment when evauating against this dataset as generated code could be harmful.

### Social Impact of Dataset
With this dataset code generating models can be better evaluated which leads to fewer issues introduced when using such models.
