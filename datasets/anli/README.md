### Dataset Summary

The Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) is a new large-scale NLI benchmark dataset,
The dataset is collected via an iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure.
ANLI is much more difficult than its predecessors including SNLI and MNLI.
It contains three rounds. Each round has train/dev/test splits.

An example of 'train_r2' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "hypothesis": "Idris Sultan was born in the first month of the year preceding 1994.",
    "label": 0,
    "premise": "\"Idris Sultan (born January 1993) is a Tanzanian Actor and comedian, actor and radio host who won the Big Brother Africa-Hotshot...",
    "reason": "",
    "uid": "ed5c37ab-77c5-4dbc-ba75-8fd617b19712"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### plain_text
- `uid`: a `string` feature.
- `premise`: a `string` feature.
- `hypothesis`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `entailment` (0), `neutral` (1), `contradiction` (2).
- `reason`: a `string` feature.
