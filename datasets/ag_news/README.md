### Dataset Summary

AG is a collection of more than 1 million news articles. News articles have been
gathered from more than 2000 news sources by ComeToMyHead in more than 1 year of
activity. ComeToMyHead is an academic news search engine which has been running
since July, 2004. The dataset is provided by the academic comunity for research
purposes in data mining (clustering, classification, etc), information retrieval
(ranking, search, etc), xml, data compression, data streaming, and any other
non-commercial activity. For more information, please refer to the link
http://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html .

The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang
(xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the dataset above. It is used as a text
classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann
LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances
in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 29.88 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 30.23 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 60.10 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "label": 3,
    "text": "New iPad released Just like every other September, this one is no different. Apple is planning to release a bigger, heavier, fatter iPad that..."
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `text`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `World` (0), `Sports` (1), `Business` (2), `Sci/Tech` (3).
