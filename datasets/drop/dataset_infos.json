{"default": {"description": "DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs.\n. DROP is a crowdsourced, adversarially-created, 96k-question benchmark, in which a system must resolve references in a \nquestion, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform discrete operations over them (such as addition, counting, or\n sorting). These operations require a much more comprehensive understanding of the content of paragraphs than what was \n necessary for prior datasets.\n", "citation": "@inproceedings{Dua2019DROP,\n  author={Dheeru Dua and Yizhong Wang and Pradeep Dasigi and Gabriel Stanovsky and Sameer Singh and Matt Gardner},\n  title={  {DROP}: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs},\n  booktitle={Proc. of NAACL},\n  year={2019}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://allennlp.org/drop", "license": "", "features": {"passage": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "question": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "answers_spans": {"feature": {"spans": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "drop", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "0.1.0", "description": null, "datasets_version_to_prepare": null, "major": 0, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 100119741, "num_examples": 77409, "dataset_name": "drop"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 10788180, "num_examples": 9536, "dataset_name": "drop"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/allennlp/datasets/drop/drop_dataset.zip": {"num_bytes": 8308692, "checksum": "39d2278a29fd729de301b111a45f434c24834f40df8f4ff116d864589e3249d6"}}, "download_size": 8308692, "dataset_size": 110907921, "size_in_bytes": 119216613}}
