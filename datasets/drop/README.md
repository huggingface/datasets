### Dataset Summary

DROP: A Reading Comprehension Benchmark Requiring Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs.
. DROP is a crowdsourced, adversarially-created, 96k-question benchmark, in which a system must resolve references in a
question, perhaps to multiple input positions, and perform discrete operations over them (such as addition, counting, or
 sorting). These operations require a much more comprehensive understanding of the content of paragraphs than what was
 necessary for prior datasets.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 7.92 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 105.77 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 113.69 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "answers_spans": {
        "spans": ["Chaz Schilens"]
    },
    "passage": "\" Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oak...",
    "question": "Who scored the first touchdown of the game?"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `passage`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `answers_spans`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `spans`: a `string` feature.
