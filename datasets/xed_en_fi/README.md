### Dataset Summary

This is the XED dataset. The dataset consists of emotion annotated movie subtitles from OPUS. We use Plutchik's 8 core emotions to annotate. The data is multilabel. The original annotations have been sourced for mainly English and Finnish.
For the English data we used Stanford NER (named entity recognition) (Finkel et al., 2005) to replace names and locations with the tags: [PERSON] and [LOCATION] respectively.
For the Finnish data, we replaced names and locations using the Turku NER corpus (Luoma et al., 2020).
