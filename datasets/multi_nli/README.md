### Dataset Summary

The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) corpus is a
crowd-sourced collection of 433k sentence pairs annotated with textual
entailment information. The corpus is modeled on the SNLI corpus, but differs in
that covers a range of genres of spoken and written text, and supports a
distinctive cross-genre generalization evaluation. The corpus served as the
basis for the shared task of the RepEval 2017 Workshop at EMNLP in Copenhagen.

### Languages

The dataset contains samples in English only.

### Data Instances

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 216.34 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 73.39 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 289.74 MB

Example of a data instance:

```
{
    "promptID": 31193,
    "pairID": "31193n",
    "premise": "Conceptually cream skimming has two basic dimensions - product and geography.",
    "premise_binary_parse": "( ( Conceptually ( cream skimming ) ) ( ( has ( ( ( two ( basic dimensions ) ) - ) ( ( product and ) geography ) ) ) . ) )",
    "premise_parse": "(ROOT (S (NP (JJ Conceptually) (NN cream) (NN skimming)) (VP (VBZ has) (NP (NP (CD two) (JJ basic) (NNS dimensions)) (: -) (NP (NN product) (CC and) (NN geography)))) (. .)))",
    "hypothesis": "Product and geography are what make cream skimming work. ",
    "hypothesis_binary_parse": "( ( ( Product and ) geography ) ( ( are ( what ( make ( cream ( skimming work ) ) ) ) ) . ) )",
    "hypothesis_parse": "(ROOT (S (NP (NN Product) (CC and) (NN geography)) (VP (VBP are) (SBAR (WHNP (WP what)) (S (VP (VBP make) (NP (NP (NN cream)) (VP (VBG skimming) (NP (NN work)))))))) (. .)))",
    "genre": "government",
    "label": 1
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

- `promptID`: Unique identifier for prompt
- `pairID`: Unique identifier for pair
- `{premise,hypothesis}`: combination of `premise` and `hypothesis`
- `{premise,hypothesis} parse`: Each sentence as parsed by the Stanford PCFG Parser 3.5.2
- `{premise,hypothesis} binary parse`: parses in unlabeled binary-branching format
- `genre`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `entailment` (0), `neutral` (1), `contradiction` (2). Dataset instances which don't have any gold label are marked with -1 label. Make sure you filter them before starting the training using `datasets.Dataset.filter`.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

They constructed MultiNLI so as to make it possible to explicitly evaluate models both on the quality of their sentence representations within the training domain and on their ability to derive reasonable representations in unfamiliar domains.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

They created each sentence pair by selecting a premise sentence from a preexisting text source and asked a human annotator to compose a novel sentence to pair with it as a hypothesis.
