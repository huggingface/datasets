### Dataset Summary

MultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension) is a dataset of short paragraphs and multi-sentence questions that can be answered from the content of the paragraph.

We have designed the dataset with three key challenges in mind:
- The number of correct answer-options for each question is not pre-specified. This removes the over-reliance of current approaches on answer-options and forces them to decide on the correctness of each candidate answer independently of others. In other words, unlike previous work, the task here is not to simply identify the best answer-option, but to evaluate the correctness of each answer-option individually.
- The correct answer(s) is not required to be a span in the text.
- The paragraphs in our dataset have diverse provenance by being extracted from 7 different domains such as news, fiction, historical text etc., and hence are expected to be more diverse in their contents as compared to single-domain datasets.

The goal of this dataset is to encourage the research community to explore approaches that can do more than sophisticated lexical-level matching.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 1.59 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 60.70 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 62.29 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "evidences": "[\"Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close .\", \"Opening a side drawer , he took out a piece of paper and his ink...",
    "label": 0,
    "passage": "\"Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close .\\nOpening a side drawer , he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot...",
    "query_and_answer": "Name few objects said to be in or on Allan 's desk || Eraser"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `passage`: a `string` feature.
- `query_and_answer`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `False` (0), `True` (1).
- `evidences`: a `list` of `string` features.
