### Dataset Summary

Eraser Multi RC is a dataset for queries over multi-line passages, along with
answers and a rationalte. Each example in this dataset has the following 5 parts
1. A Mutli-line Passage
2. A Query about the passage
3. An Answer to the query
4. A Classification as to whether the answer is right or wrong
5. An Explanation justifying the classification

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 1.59 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 60.70 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 62.29 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "evidences": "[\"Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close .\", \"Opening a side drawer , he took out a piece of paper and his ink...",
    "label": 0,
    "passage": "\"Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close .\\nOpening a side drawer , he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot...",
    "query_and_answer": "Name few objects said to be in or on Allan 's desk || Eraser"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `passage`: a `string` feature.
- `query_and_answer`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `False` (0), `True` (1).
- `evidences`: a `list` of `string` features.
