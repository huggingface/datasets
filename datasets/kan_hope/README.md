This dataset also has class imbalance problems depicting real-world scenarios.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Numerous methods have been developed to monitor the spread of negativity in modern years by eliminating vulgar, offensive, and fierce comments from social media platforms. However, there are relatively lesser amounts of study that converges on embracing positivity, reinforcing supportive and reassuring content in online forums.
