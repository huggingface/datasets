### Dataset Summary

This is the wikipedia split used to evaluate the Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) model.
It contains 21M passages from wikipedia along with their DPR embeddings.
The wikipedia articles were split into multiple, disjoint text blocks of 100 words as passages.

The wikipedia dump is the one from Dec. 20, 2018.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

Each instance contains a paragraph of at most 100 words, as well as the title of the wikipedia page it comes from, and the DPR embedding (a 768-d vector).
