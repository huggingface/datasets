{"thai_toxicity_tweet": {"description": "Thai Toxicity Tweet Corpus contains 3,300 tweets annotated by humans with guidelines including a 44-word dictionary.\nThe author obtained 2,027 and 1,273 toxic and non-toxic tweets, respectively; these were labeled by three annotators. The result of corpus\nanalysis indicates that tweets that include toxic words are not always toxic. Further, it is more likely that a tweet is toxic, if it contains\ntoxic words indicating their original meaning. Moreover, disagreements in annotation are primarily because of sarcasm, unclear existing\ntarget, and word sense ambiguity.\n\nNotes from data cleaner: The data is included into [huggingface/datasets](https://www.github.com/huggingface/datasets) in Dec 2020.\nBy this time, 506 of the tweets are not available publicly anymore. We denote these by `TWEET_NOT_FOUND` in `tweet_text`. \nProcessing can be found at [this PR](https://github.com/tmu-nlp/ThaiToxicityTweetCorpus/pull/1).\n", "citation": "@article{sirihattasak2019annotation,\n  title={Annotation and Classification of Toxicity for Thai Twitter},\n  author={Sirihattasak, Sugan and Komachi, Mamoru and Ishikawa, Hiroshi},\n  year={2019}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://github.com/tmu-nlp/ThaiToxicityTweetCorpus/", "license": "", "features": {"tweet_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "tweet_text": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "toxic_votes": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "nontoxic_votes": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "is_toxic": {"num_classes": 2, "names": ["neg", "pos"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "thai_toxicity_tweet", "config_name": "thai_toxicity_tweet", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 637387, "num_examples": 3300, "dataset_name": "thai_toxicity_tweet"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://archive.org/download/ThaiToxicityTweetCorpus/data.zip": {"num_bytes": 194740, "checksum": "4d2af31fe7398e31a5b9ff1a6cc2b4f57cdd4a1eff3b7f49a8157acc31b109eb"}}, "download_size": 194740, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 637387, "size_in_bytes": 832127}}
