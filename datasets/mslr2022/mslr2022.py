The Multidocument Summarization for Literature Review (MSLR) Shared Task aims to study how medical
evidence from different clinical studies are summarized in literature reviews. Reviews provide the
highest quality of evidence for clinical care, but are expensive to produce manually.
(Semi-)automation via NLP may facilitate faster evidence synthesis without sacrificing rigor. The
MSLR shared task uses two datasets to assess the current state of multidocument summarization for
this task, and to encourage the development of modeling contributions, scaffolding tasks, methods
for model interpretability, and improved automated evaluation methods in this domain.
