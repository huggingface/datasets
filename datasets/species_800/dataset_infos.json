{"species_800": {"description": "We have developed an efficient algorithm and implementation of a dictionary-based approach to named entity recognition,\nwhich we here use to identifynames of species and other taxa in text. The tool, SPECIES, is more than an order of\nmagnitude faster and as accurate as existing tools. The precision and recall was assessed both on an existing gold-standard\ncorpus and on a new corpus of 800 abstracts, which were manually annotated after the development of the tool. The corpus\ncomprises abstracts from journals selected to represent many taxonomic groups, which gives insights into which types of\norganism names are hard to detect and which are easy. Finally, we have tagged organism names in the entire Medline database\nand developed a web resource, ORGANISMS, that makes the results accessible to the broad community of biologists.\n", "citation": "@article{pafilis2013species,\n         title={The SPECIES and ORGANISMS resources for fast and accurate identification of taxonomic names in text},\n         author={Pafilis, Evangelos and Frankild, Sune P and Fanini, Lucia and Faulwetter, Sarah and Pavloudi, Christina and Vasileiadou, Aikaterini and Arvanitidis, Christos and Jensen, Lars Juhl},\n         journal={PloS one},\n         volume={8},\n         number={6},\n         pages={e65390},\n         year={2013},\n         publisher={Public Library of Science}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://species.jensenlab.org/", "license": "", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "tokens": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "ner_tags": {"feature": {"num_classes": 3, "names": ["O", "B", "I"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "species800", "config_name": "species_800", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 2579096, "num_examples": 5734, "dataset_name": "species800"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 385756, "num_examples": 831, "dataset_name": "species800"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 737760, "num_examples": 1631, "dataset_name": "species800"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1OletxmPYNkz2ltOr9pyT0b0iBtUWxslh&export=download/": {"num_bytes": 18204624, "checksum": "30522c752fd90e6da05f117a52da13174b246e4980e46840e6e1737dc67e1d27"}}, "download_size": 18204624, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 3702612, "size_in_bytes": 21907236}}
