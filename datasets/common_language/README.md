### Dataset Summary

This dataset is composed of speech recordings from languages that were carefully selected from the CommonVoice database. The total duration of audio recordings is 45.1 hours (i.e., 1 hour of material for each language). The dataset has been extracted from CommonVoice to train language-id systems.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The baselines for language-id are available in the SpeechBrain toolkit (see recipes/CommonLanguage):
https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain

### Languages

List of included languages:
```
Arabic, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Chinese_China, Chinese_Hongkong, Chinese_Taiwan, Chuvash, Czech, Dhivehi, Dutch, English, Esperanto, Estonian, French, Frisian, Georgian, German, Greek, Hakha_Chin, Indonesian, Interlingua, Italian, Japanese, Kabyle, Kinyarwanda, Kyrgyz, Latvian, Maltese, Mongolian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Romansh_Sursilvan, Russian, Sakha, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Tatar, Turkish, Ukranian, Welsh
```

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises the `path` to the audio file, and its label `language`. Additional fields include `age`, `client_id`, `gender` and `sentence`.

```python
{
  'client_id': 'itln_trn_sp_175',
  'path': '/path/common_voice_kpd/Italian/train/itln_trn_sp_175/common_voice_it_18279446.wav',
  'audio': {'path': '/path/common_voice_kpd/Italian/train/itln_trn_sp_175/common_voice_it_18279446.wav',
		   'array': array([-0.00048828, -0.00018311, -0.00137329, ...,  0.00079346, 0.00091553,  0.00085449], dtype=float32),
		   'sampling_rate': 48000},
  'sentence': 'Con gli studenti Ã¨ leggermente simile.',
  'age': 'not_defined',
  'gender': 'not_defined',
  'language': 22
}
```

### Data Fields

`client_id` (`string`): An id for which client (voice) made the recording

`path` (`string`): The path to the audio file

- `audio` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the path to the downloaded audio file, the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"audio"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["audio"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`.

`language` (`ClassLabel`): The language of the recording (see the `Languages` section above)

`sentence` (`string`): The sentence the user was prompted to speak

`age` (`string`): The age of the speaker.

`gender` (`string`): The gender of the speaker

### Data Splits

The dataset is already balanced and split into train, dev (validation) and test sets. 

| Name                              | Train  | Dev    | Test  |

| **# unique speakers**             | 11189  | 1297   | 1322  |
| **Total duration, hr**            | 30.04  | 7.53   | 7.53  |

| **Mean duration, sec**            | 4.87   | 4.61   | 4.55  |
| **Max duration, sec**             | 21.72  | 105.67 | 29.83 |
| **Duration per language, min**    | ~40    | ~10    | ~10   |
