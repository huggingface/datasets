### Dataset Summary

This dataset contains hourly kW electricity consumption time series of 370 Portuguese clients from 2011 to 2014.

### Dataset Usage

The dataset has the following configuration parameters:

- `freq` is the time series frequency at which we resample (default: `"1H"`)
- `prediction_length` is the forecast horizon for this task which is used to make the validation and test splits (default: `24`)
- `rolling_evaluations` is the number of rolling window time series in the test split for evaluation purposes (default: `7`)

For example, you can specify your own configuration different from those used in the papers as follows:

```python
load_dataset("electricity_load_diagrams", "uci", rolling_evaluations=10)
```

> Notes:
> - Data set has no missing values.
> - Values are in kW of each 15 min rescaled to hourly. To convert values in kWh values must be divided by 4.
> - All time labels report to Portuguese hour, however all days present 96 measures (24*4). 
> - Every year in March time change day (which has only 23 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am are zero for all points. 
> - Every year in October time change day (which has 25 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am aggregate the consumption of two hours.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `univariate-time-series-forecasting`: The time series forecasting tasks involves learning the future `target` values of time series in a dataset for the `prediction_length` time steps. The results of the forecasts can then be validated via the ground truth in the `validation` split and tested via the `test` split.

### Languages

## Dataset Structure

Data set has no missing values. The raw values are in kW of each 15 min interval and are resampled to hourly frequency. 
Each time series represent one client. Some clients were created after 2011. In these cases consumption were considered zero. All time labels report to Portuguese hour, however all days contain 96 measurements (24*4). Every year in March time change day (which has only 23 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am are zero for all points. Every year in October time change day (which has 25 hours) the values between 1:00 am and 2:00 am aggregate the consumption of two hours.

### Data Instances

A sample from the training set is provided below:

```
{
  'start': datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 1, 0, 0),
  'target': [14.0, 18.0, 21.0, 20.0, 22.0, 20.0, 20.0, 20.0, 13.0, 11.0], # <= this target array is a concatenated sample
  'feat_static_cat': [0], 
  'item_id': '0'
}
```

We have two configurations `uci` and `lstnet`, which are specified as follows. 

The time series are resampled to hourly frequency. We test on 7 rolling windows of prediction length of 24. 

The `uci` validation therefore ends 24*7 time steps before the end of each time series. The training split ends 24 time steps before the end of the validation split. 

For the `lsnet` configuration we split the training window so that it is 0.6-th of the full time series and the validation is  0.8-th of the full time series and the last 0.2-th length time windows is used as the test set of 7 rolling windows of the 24 time steps each. Finally, as in the LSTNet paper, we only consider time series that are active in the year 2012--2014, which leaves us with 320 time series.

### Data Fields

For this univariate regular time series we have:

- `start`: a `datetime` of the first entry of each time series in the dataset
- `target`: an `array[float32]` of the actual target values
- `feat_static_cat`: an `array[uint64]` which contains a categorical identifier of each time series in the dataset
- `item_id`: a string identifier of each time series in a dataset for reference

Given the `freq` and the `start` datetime, we can assign a datetime to each entry in the target array.

### Data Splits

|   name   |train|unsupervised|test |
|----------|----:|-----------:|----:|
|uci|370|       2590|370|
|lstnet|320|       2240|320|

## Dataset Creation

The Electricity Load Diagrams 2011â€“2014 Dataset was developed by Artur Trindade and shared in UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset covers the electricity load of 370 substations in Portugal from the start of 2011 to the end of 2014 with a sampling period of 15 min. We will resample this to hourly time series.

### Curation Rationale

Research and development of load forecasting methods. In particular short-term electricity forecasting.
