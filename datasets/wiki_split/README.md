### [Dataset Summary](#dataset-summary)

One million English sentences, each split into two sentences that together preserve the original meaning, extracted from Wikipedia
Google's WikiSplit dataset was constructed automatically from the publicly available Wikipedia revision history. Although
the dataset contains some inherent noise, it can serve as valuable training data for models that split or merge sentences.

## [Dataset Structure](#dataset-structure)

We show detailed information for up to 5 configurations of the dataset.

### [Data Instances](#data-instances)

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 95.63 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 370.41 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 466.04 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "complex_sentence": " '' As she translates from one language to another , she tries to find the appropriate wording and context in English that would correspond to the work in Spanish her poems and stories started to have differing meanings in their respective languages .",
    "simple_sentence_1": "' '' As she translates from one language to another , she tries to find the appropriate wording and context in English that would correspond to the work in Spanish . ",
    "simple_sentence_2": " Ergo , her poems and stories started to have differing meanings in their respective languages ."
}
```

### [Data Fields](#data-fields)

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `complex_sentence`: a `string` feature.
- `simple_sentence_1`: a `string` feature.
- `simple_sentence_2`: a `string` feature.
