### Dataset Summary

`generated_reviews_enth` is created as part of [scb-mt-en-th-2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03541.pdf) for machine translation task. This dataset (referred to as `generated_reviews_yn` in [scb-mt-en-th-2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03541.pdf)) are English product reviews generated by [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858), translated by Google Translate API and annotated as accepted or rejected (`correct`) based on fluency and adequacy of the translation by human annotators. This allows it to be used for English-to-Thai translation quality esitmation (binary label), machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

English-to-Thai translation quality esitmation (binary label) is the intended use. Other uses include machine translation and sentiment analysis.

### Languages

English, Thai

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

```
{'en_segment': 'Best value in a hard to obtain item. The item was new with the box. I have purchased many times, and will continue to purchase as needed. Thank you very much!', 'th_segment': 'คุ้มค่าที่สุดในการรับไอเท็มยาก ๆ สินค้าเป็นของใหม่พร้อมกล่อง ฉันซื้อหลายครั้งและจะซื้อต่อไปตามความจำเป็น ขอบคุณมาก!', 'review_star': 5, 'correct': 0}
{'en_segment': 'I am an avid Amazon reader since my first Kindle and I love to purchase books, movies, etc. from Amazon. This book was not the typical style of a John Grisham book. It came as a surprise from all the great reviews. The book starts out with no explanation on how these victims are able to tell each other apart. Not very believable. But, like most books by John, this one held my interest.', 'th_segment': 'ฉันเป็นนักอ่านตัวยงของ Amazon ตั้งแต่ Kindle ตัวแรกและฉันชอบซื้อหนังสือภาพยนตร์และอื่น ๆ จาก Amazon หนังสือเล่มนี้ไม่ได้เป็นแบบฉบับของหนังสือ John Grisham มันมาจากความคิดเห็นที่ยอดเยี่ยมทั้งหมด 
{'en_segment': 'These things rip so easily.', 'th_segment': 'สิ่งเหล่านี้ฉีกง่ายมาก', 'review_star': 1, 'correct': 1
```

### Data Fields

- `en_segment`: English product reviews generated by [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858)
- `th_segment`: Thai product reviews translated from `en_segment` by Google Translate API
- `review_star`: Stars of the generated reviews, put as condition for [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858)
- `correct`: 1 if the English-to-Thai translation is accepted (`correct`) based on fluency and adequacy of the translation by human annotators else 0

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

`generated_reviews_enth` is created as part of [scb-mt-en-th-2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03541.pdf) for machine translation task. This dataset (referred to as `generated_reviews_yn` in [scb-mt-en-th-2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03541.pdf)) are English product reviews generated by [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858), translated by Google Translate API and annotated as accepted or rejected (`correct`) based on fluency and adequacy of the translation by human annotators. This allows it to be used for English-to-Thai translation quality esitmation (binary label), machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The data generation process is as follows:
- `en_segment` is generated using conditional generation of [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858), stating a star review for each generated product review. 
- `th_segment` is translated from `en_segment` using Google Translate API
- `correct` is annotated as accepted or rejected (1 or 0) based on fluency and adequacy of the translation by human annotators

For this specific dataset for translation quality estimation task, we apply the following preprocessing:
- Drop duplciates on `en_segment`,`th_segment`,`review_star`,`correct`; duplicates might exist because the translation checking is done by annotators.
- Remove reviews that are not between 1-5 stars.
- Remove reviews whose `correct` are not 0 or 1.
- Deduplicate on `en_segment` which contains the source sentences.

#### Who are the source language producers?

[CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858)

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Annotators are given English and Thai product review pairs. They are asked to label the pair as acceptable translation or not based on fluency and adequacy of the translation.

#### Who are the annotators?

Human annotators of [Hope Data Annotations](https://www.hopedata.org/) hired by [AIResearch.in.th](http://airesearch.in.th/)

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The authors do not expect any personal or sensitive information to be in the generated product reviews, but they could slip through from pretraining of [CTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858).

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

- English-Thai translation quality estimation for machine translation
- Product review classification for Thai

### Discussion of Biases

[More Information Needed]

### Other Known Limitations

Due to annotation process constraints, the number of one-star reviews are notably higher than other-star reviews. This makes the dataset slighly imbalanced.
