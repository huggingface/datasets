In contrast, humans can solve new tasks by reading some instructions, with perhaps an example or two. To take a step toward closing this gap, we introduce a framework for developing NLP systems that solve new tasks after reading their descriptions, synthesizing prior work in this area. We instantiate this frame- work with a new English language dataset, ZEST, structured for task-oriented evaluation on unseen tasks. Formulating task descriptions as questions, we ensure each is general enough to apply to many possible inputs, thus comprehensively evaluating a model{'}s ability to solve each task. Moreover, the dataset{'}s structure tests specific types of systematic generalization. We find that the state-of-the-art T5 model achieves a score of 12{\\%} on ZEST, leaving a significant challenge for NLP researchers.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "https://allenai.org/data/zest", "license": "", "features": {"task_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "question": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "generalization_type": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "derives_from": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "domain": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "context": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "answer": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "all_answers": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "zest", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "0.0.0", "description": null, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 9588987, "num_examples": 10766, "dataset_name": "zest"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 2056804, "num_examples": 2280, "dataset_name": "zest"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 9280845, "num_examples": 11980, "dataset_name": "zest"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://ai2-datasets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/zest/zest.zip": {"num_bytes": 5796188, "checksum": "91b8e41470281e774034b2f2a42a5cb36a8ff4f7d17517123d51208aa9af795f"}}, "download_size": 5796188, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 20926636, "size_in_bytes": 26722824}}
