## Dataset Structure

We show detailed information for up to 5 configurations of the dataset.

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 1.97 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 2.07 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 4.05 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "label": 0,
    "text": "im feeling quite sad and sorry for myself but ill snap out of it soon"
}
```

#### emotion

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 1.97 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 2.09 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 4.06 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```

```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `text`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `sadness` (0), `joy` (1), `love` (2), `anger` (3), `fear` (4), `surprise` (5).

#### emotion
- `text`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a `string` feature.

### Data Splits

    abstract = "Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",
