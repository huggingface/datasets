Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "https://github.com/dair-ai/emotion_dataset", "license": "", "features": {"text": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "label": {"num_classes": 6, "names": ["sadness", "joy", "love", "anger", "fear", "surprise"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": {"input": "text", "output": "label"}, "task_templates": [{"task": "text-classification", "text_column": "text", "label_column": "label", "labels": ["anger", "fear", "joy", "love", "sadness", "surprise"]}], "builder_name": "emotion", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "0.0.0", "description": null, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 1741541, "num_examples": 16000, "dataset_name": "emotion"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 214699, "num_examples": 2000, "dataset_name": "emotion"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 217177, "num_examples": 2000, "dataset_name": "emotion"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1pzkadrvffbqw6o/train.txt?dl=1": {"num_bytes": 1658616, "checksum": "3ab03d945a6cb783d818ccd06dafd52d2ed8b4f62f0f85a09d7d11870865b190"}, "https://www.dropbox.com/s/2mzialpsgf9k5l3/val.txt?dl=1": {"num_bytes": 204240, "checksum": "34faaa31962fe63cdf5dbf6c132ef8ab166c640254ab991af78f3aea375e79ef"}, "https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikkqxfdbdec3fuj/test.txt?dl=1": {"num_bytes": 206760, "checksum": "60f531690d20127339e7f054edc299a82c627b5ec0dd5d552d53d544e0cfcc17"}}, "download_size": 2069616, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 2173417, "size_in_bytes": 4243033}}
