### Data Instances

```
{
    "guten_id": 28999,
    "hour_reference": 12,
    "time_phrase": "midday",
    "is_ambiguous": False,
    "time_pos_start": 133,
    "time_pos_end": 134,
    "tok_context": "Sorrows and trials she had had in plenty in her life , but these the sweetness of her nature had transformed , so that from being things difficult to bear , she had built up with them her own character . Sorrow had increased her own power of sympathy ; out of trials she had learnt patience ; and failure and the gradual sinking of one she had loved into the bottomless slough of evil habit had but left her with an added dower of pity and tolerance . So the past had no sting left , and if iron had ever entered into her soul it now but served to make it strong . She was still young , too ; it was not near sunset with her yet , nor even midday , and the future that , humanly speaking , she counted to be hers was almost dazzling in its brightness . For love had dawned for her again , and no uncertain love , wrapped in the mists of memory , but one that had ripened through liking and friendship and intimacy into the authentic glory . He was in England , too ; she was going back to him . And before very long she would never go away from him again ."

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The flow of time is an indispensable guide for our actions, and provides a framework in which to see a logical progression of events. Just as in real life,the clock provides the background against which literary works play out: when characters wake, eat,and act. In most works of fiction, the events of the story take place during recognizable time periods over the course of the day. Recognizing a storyâ€™s flow through time is essential to understanding the text.In this paper, we try to capture the flow of time through novels by attempting to recognize what time of day each event in the story takes place at.
