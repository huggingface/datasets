 The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was introduced in 1975 , with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford . It was larger than the Scientific , at 73 by 155 by 34 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 9 in × 6 @.@ 1 in × 1 @.@ 3 in ) , and used a larger  battery , but could also be powered by mains electricity .
 It had 24 @-@ step programming abilities , which meant it was highly limited for many purposes . It also lacked functions for the natural logarithm and exponential function . Constants used in programs were required to be integers , and the programming was wasteful , with start and end quotes needed to use a constant in a program .
 However , included with the calculator was a library of over 120 programs that that performed common operations in mathematics , geometry , statistics , finance , physics , electronics , engineering , as well as fluid mechanics and materials science . The full library of standard programs contained over 400 programs in the Sinclair Program Library
