### Dataset Summary

- Dataset for Natural Language Inference in Hindi Language. BBC Hindi Dataset consists of textual-entailment pairs.
- Each row of the Datasets if made up of 4 columns - Premise, Hypothesis, Label and Topic.
- Context and Hypothesis is written in Hindi while Entailment_Label is in English.
- Entailment_label is of 2 types - entailed and not-entailed.
- Dataset can be used to train models for Natural Language Inference tasks in Hindi Language.
[More Information Needed]

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- Natural Language Inference for Hindi

### Languages

Dataset is in Hindi

## Dataset Structure

- Data is structured in TSV format. 
- Train and Test files are in seperate files


### Dataset Instances

An example of 'train' looks as follows.

```
{'hypothesis': 'यह खबर की सूचना है|', 'label': 'entailed', 'premise': 'गोपनीयता की नीति', 'topic': '1'}

```
### Data Fields

- Each row contatins 4 columns - Premise, Hypothesis, Label and Topic.

### Data Splits

- Train : 15553
- Valid : 2581
- Test : 2593

## Dataset Creation

- We employ a recasting technique from Poliak et al. (2018a,b) to convert publicly available BBC Hindi news text classification datasets in Hindi and pose them as TE problems
- In this recasting process, we build template hypotheses for each class in the label taxonomy
- Then, we pair the original annotated sentence with each of the template hypotheses to create TE samples.
- For more information on the recasting process, refer to paper "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.aacl-main.71"

### Source Data

Source Dataset for the recasting process is the BBC Hindi Headlines Dataset(https://github.com/NirantK/hindi2vec/releases/tag/bbc-hindi-v0.1)

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

-  BBC Hindi News Classification Dataset contains 4, 335 Hindi news headlines tagged across 14 categories: India, Pakistan,news, International, entertainment, sport, science, China, learning english, social, southasia, business, institutional, multimedia
-  We processed this dataset to combine two sets of relevant but low prevalence classes.
- Namely, we merged the samples from Pakistan, China, international, and southasia as one class called international.
- Likewise, we also merged samples from news, business, social, learning english, and institutional as news.
- Lastly, we also removed the class multimedia because there were very few samples.

    abstract = "An NLP model{'}s ability to reason should be independent of language. Previous works utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) to understand the reasoning ability of models, mostly focusing on high resource languages like English. To address scarcity of data in low-resource languages such as Hindi, we use data recasting to create NLI datasets for four existing text classification datasets. Through experiments, we show that our recasted dataset is devoid of statistical irregularities and spurious patterns. We further study the consistency in predictions of the textual entailment models and propose a consistency regulariser to remove pairwise-inconsistencies in predictions. We propose a novel two-step classification method which uses textual-entailment predictions for classification task. We further improve the performance by using a joint-objective for classification and textual entailment. We therefore highlight the benefits of data recasting and improvements on classification performance using our approach with supporting experimental results.",
