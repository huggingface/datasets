### Dataset Summary

AQuaMuSe is a novel scalable approach to automatically mine dual query based multi-document summarization datasets for extractive and abstractive summaries using question answering dataset (Google Natural Questions) and large document corpora (Common Crawl)

This dataset contains versions of automatically generated datasets for abstractive and extractive query-based multi-document summarization as described in [AQuaMuSe paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12694.pdf).
### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- **Abstractive** and **Extractive** query-based multi-document summarization
- Question Answering

### Languages

en : English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

- `input_urls`: a `list` of `string` features. 
- `query`: a `string` feature.
- `target`: a `string` feature


Example: 

```
{
    'input_urls': ['https://boxofficebuz.com/person/19653-charles-michael-davis'],
     'query': 'who is the actor that plays marcel on the originals',
     'target': "In February 2013, it was announced that Davis was cast in a lead role on The CW's new show The 
Originals, a spinoff of The Vampire Diaries, centered on the Original Family as they move to New Orleans, where 
Davis' character (a vampire named Marcel) currently rules."
}
```

### Data Fields

 - `input_urls`: a `list` of `string` features. 
  - List of URLs to input documents pointing to  [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/2017/07/june-2017-crawl-archive-now-available)  to be summarized. 
  - Dependencies: Documents URLs references the  [Common Crawl June 2017 Archive](https://commoncrawl.org/2017/07/june-2017-crawl-archive-now-available).
  
 - `query`: a `string` feature.
  - Input query to be used as summarization context. This is  derived from  [Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/)  user queries.
  
 -  `target`: a `string` feature
  - Summarization target, derived from  [Natural Questions](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions/)  long answers.
### Data Splits
 - This dataset has two high-level configurations `abstractive` and `extractive`
 - Each configuration has the data splits of `train`, `dev` and `test`
 - The original format of the data was in [TFrecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord), which has been parsed to the format as specified in [Data Instances](#data-instances)
