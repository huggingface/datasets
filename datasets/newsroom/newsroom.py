_DESCRIPTION = """
NEWSROOM is a large dataset for training and evaluating summarization systems.
It contains 1.3 million articles and summaries written by authors and
editors in the newsrooms of 38 major publications.

Dataset features includes:
  - text: Input news text.
  - summary: Summary for the news.
And additional features:
  - title: news title.
  - url: url of the news.
  - date: date of the article.
  - density: extractive density.
  - coverage: extractive coverage.
  - compression: compression ratio.
  - density_bin: low, medium, high.
  - coverage_bin: extractive, abstractive.
  - compression_bin: low, medium, high.

This dataset can be downloaded upon requests. Unzip all the contents
"train.jsonl, dev.josnl, test.jsonl" to the tfds folder.
