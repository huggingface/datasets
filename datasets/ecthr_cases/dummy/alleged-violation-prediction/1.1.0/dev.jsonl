On 10 January 2011 the applicant lodged a request with the Director of Prison and the Penitentiary judge for leave to attend her funeral which was to take place on 12 January 2011.

The applicant was born in 1982 and is currently detained in Cricova.", "6.  In 2002 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office initiated a criminal investigation against the applicant on charges of murder and a detention warrant in respect of him was issued by the Buiucani District Court on 14 February 2002. Since the applicant had left the country, an international search order was issued.", "7.  In December 2010 the applicant was arrested in the Russian Federation and extradited to Moldova, where he was placed in detention on 29 December 2010 on the basis of the detention warrant of 14 February 2002. The applicant lodged a habeas corpus request in which he complained, inter alia, that he had not been informed about the detention warrant of 14 February 2002 within seventy-two hours, as provided by law, and that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons to deprive him of his liberty. However, the request was rejected on the ground, inter alia, that he had been in hiding and that he could abscond again. Later the detention warrant was renewed several times on similar grounds and the applicant\u2019s appeals were rejected. The last decision in the proceedings concerning his remand in custody dates from 27 May 2011 and it was issued by the Buiucani District Court. By that decision the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was prolonged until 29 June 2011.", "8.  During his detention the applicant was jailed in Prison no. 13 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u between 29 December 2010 and 22 March 2012 and after 10 January 2013. The applicant alleges that the cells were overcrowded and dirty; there was no ventilation system; there was no sufficient natural light because the windows were very small; the daily walks lasted for only one hour and the food served was of a very poor quality. In particular he submitted that due to the overcrowding each inmate only had between 1.5 and 2 square metres of available space in the cells. The toilets were separated from the rest of the cells by a wall which was seventy centimetres high or by a curtain and were located at a distance of some 1.5 metres from the table where the inmates served their meals. The inmates were allowed to take showers only once a week and were subjected to passive smoking.", "9.  On 14 June 2011 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. After this date no more detention warrants were issued and he continued to be detained on the basis of the above sentence. The Court was not informed about subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.", "10.  The relevant parts of the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment compiled following his visit to Moldova from 4 to 11 July 2008 (The United Nations Human Rights Council, document A/HRC/10/44/Add.3, 12 February 2009) read:\n\u201cB.  Conditions in places of detention\nInstitutions under the Ministry of Justice 30.  Undoubtedly, progress has been achieved in improving conditions of detention. However, some of the institutions visited by the Special Rapporteur were heavily overcrowded. The authorities themselves pointed out that Institution No. 13 in Chi\u015fin\u0103u was severely overcrowded - on the day of the visit it held 931 persons with the official capacity being 600 (see also appendix). The Special Rapporteur was informed of Government plans to close down this institution. 31.  Common problems at all pre- and post-trial prisons are the poor hygienic conditions, restricted access to health care and lack of medication as well as risk of contamination with tuberculosis and other diseases. Whereas the Special Rapporteur notes that the minimum norms regarding nutrition of detainees (Government Decision n. 609 of 29 May 2006) are checked on a daily basis and that, according to the financial plan of the Penitentiary Department, the food budget for 2008 had almost doubled in comparison to 2004 and is set to rise further, he also received consistent allegations regarding the poor quality and quantity of food. ...\u201d", "11.  In its report for 2009 (page 117, \u201cConditions of detention\u201d), the Centre for Human Rights in Moldova (\u201cthe Human Rights Centre\u201d, which also acts as the Moldovan Ombudsman) found, inter alia, that:\n\u201cRegarding personal hygiene, clothing and bedding, despite [the fact that] Government decision no. 609 (29 May 2006) concerning minimum daily food requirements and the issuing of items of personal hygiene provides for the issuing of soap to detainees for bathing and other sanitary-hygienic needs, this has remained unfulfilled during 2009.\u201d", "12.  In its report for 2010 (page 142 et seq. \u201cConditions of detention\u201d) the Human Rights Centre found, inter alia, that:\n\u201cFailure to adhere to the statutory cell size (4 square metres per person) in the living blocks of the institution has become an unpleasant problem which now affects the prison system across the entire country. ...\nThe same situation was confirmed during a visit to Chi\u015fin\u0103u Prison no. 13 on 9 September 2010. In some cells the living space was not proportionate to the number of detainees. During the visit, eight detainees were being held in cell no. 38, which measured 24 square metres. This situation has been seen repeatedly during visits by the Centre\u2019s staff to the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Pre-trial Detention Centre. Similar findings were made during visits to Rusca Prison no. 7 on 19 May 2010, where six detainees were being held in a cell measuring 15.5 square metres and to Cricova Prison no. 4, where (in living block no. 7) over twenty detainees were being held in a cell measuring 65 square metres.\nOvercrowding comes directly within the Ombudsman\u2019s remit as part of the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, which on many occasions has recognised overcrowding in the country\u2019s prisons. ...\n... [T]he Prisons Department informed the Ombudsman that meat and fish products are provided [to detainees] whenever possible. At the same time, the authority stated that, owing to the difficult financial situation, during 2010 the detainees in Rezina Prison no. 17 received only 75% and 80% of their normal quotas of meat and fish products respectively. In this connection, the Minister of Justice provided information to the Ombudsman about the expenditure on prisoners\u2019 food in 2010. The cost amounted to MDL 24.05 million, whereas the budgetary need for the same year was, according to the Ministry of Finance\u2019s draft budget, MDL 29.05 million. The daily cost of feeding a detainee in 2010 was MDL 10.24, whilst the daily budgetary need was MDL 12.35. This statistic was often cited by prison authorities to justify why they were unable to provide detainees with meat and fish.\n...\nAs regards sanitary conditions, lighting and ventilation problems continue to exist in the majority of living blocks in Moldovan prisons, with the exception of Taraclia Prisons no. 1 and Rusca Prison no. 7.\nThe Republic of Moldova inherited old gulag-type prisons in dilapidated buildings, corresponding to former Soviet standards. The prisons do not conform to current national and international standards; however, the budget constraints upon the State do not allow for their reconstruction or renovation.\n In the prisons, with the exception of Taraclia Prison no. 1, detainees are held in large-capacity cells insufficiently equipped for their daily needs, namely areas for sleeping, for everyday living and for sanitary equipment. Detainees are held in extremely overcrowded, dark, damp and unventilated spaces full of cigarette smoke. In certain prisons the bunk beds essentially prevent daylight from reaching the living space.\u201d"], "applicants": ["MESCEREACOV"], "defendants": ["MOLDOVA"], "allegedly_violated_articles": ["3"], "violated_articles": ["3"], "court_assessment_references": {"3": ["10", "11", "9"]}, "silver_rationales": [4, 5, 6], "gold_rationales": []}

At 11 a.m. on 18 March 2004 the police arrived at the applicant\u2019s flat and ordered him to follow them to the police station.", "9.  Once at the police station, the applicant explained that on 6 March 2004 he had bought a used mobile phone from a stranger because a friend of his had earlier expressed an interest in purchasing a second-hand phone. In order to test the phone, he had inserted his SIM card and made a call to his then girlfriend, Ms A. He also claimed that on the same day he had played slot machines and won RUB 2,500. Then the officers questioning him showed him a call log from Ms E.\u2019s phone, informed him of the killing and suggested that he confess to mitigate his sentence. The applicant refused to admit to the crime.", "10.  The officers proceeded to hit and kick him on his head, chest and flanks. The applicant fainted several times.

Upon arrival the police officers asked him how he had obtained Ms E.\u2019s phone and then showed him the call log. The applicant looked at the log and then asked the officers to leave him alone in the room. He then wrote a statement of surrender and confession describing the circumstances of the crime. No physical force was applied to the applicant.", "14.  In the Government\u2019s submission, on 18 March 2004 the applicant complained to the town prosecutor\u2019s office; however, he did not raise the issue of ill-treatment.", "15.

In the early morning on 19 March 2004 the applicant was placed in a temporary detention centre (\u0418\u0437\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f, hereinafter \u201cIVS\u201d).

According to the Government, during the visit the applicant confirmed his statement made in the presence of the lawyer in the course of the second interview of 19 March 2004.

On 20 March 2004 a judge of the Naro-Fominsk Town Court (\u201cthe Town Court\u201d) placed the applicant in custody. The applicant complained to the judge about his ill-treatment; she refused to take note of the allegations, however, stating that they could be examined in the course of the trial against the applicant.", "22.  On 25 March 2004 the applicant was formally charged with murder and robbery. He retracted his confession.", "23.  On 26 March 2004 the police transported the applicant to a remand prison.

On 18 June 2004 Mr A., an investigator with the town prosecutor\u2019s office, refused to initiate criminal proceedings into the alleged ill-treatment.

The latter forwarded the complaint to the town prosecutor\u2019s office (against which the complaint was directed). The applicant received no reply.", "31.

On 27 July 2004 the Regional Court scheduled a trial hearing on 9 August 2004.", "33.  The applicant raised the matter of ill-treatment before the Regional Court at his trial.", "34.  On 20 October 2004 the Regional Court ordered an expert medical examination of the X-ray of 30 March 2004. It can be seen from the trial record of that date that N. informed the judge that he was not an expert in interpreting X\u2011rays and asked for a period of two weeks to consult a colleague; the judge acceded to the request. On 4 November 2004 N. drew up a report stating that the rib fractures had been caused by blunt objects; by 30 March 2004 the knitting together of the fractures had commenced; the fractures had been \u201cconsiderably old\u201d and \u201cno injuries corresponding to [those of] 11 and 18 March 2004 [had been] identified\u201d.

On 3 December 2004 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of robbery and murder and sentenced him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. The court referred to the applicant\u2019s pre-trial confession, the record of his questioning by the investigator, his statements at the investigative re\u2011enactment and other physical evidence.", "37.  The trial judge also examined in detail the evidence presented by the parties in relation to the allegation of ill\u2011treatment, including the decision of 18 June 2004 and the expert medical report ordered in respect of the X-ray. The judge also heard evidence from an expert, N., as well as investigator Mr A. and several police officers. The judge refused to examine the IVS logbook which, according to the applicant, would support his assertion that there were injuries. Instead, the judge examined a letter from the deputy director of the IVS, according to which on his arrival there the applicant only had had a black eye which he had explained as having received before the arrest. The deputy director had also noted that the logbook entry concerning the call for an ambulance had been made for another person. The judge dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment and declared the relevant evidence (the confession statement, the interview record and the investigative re-enactment record) admissible.", "38.  On 6 December 2004 the applicant lodged an appeal reiterating the issue of his confession under duress without a lawyer present, as well as the weakness of the prosecution\u2019s case against him. He insisted on his innocence.", "39.  On 14 December 2004 the applicant lodged an additional appeal in which he claimed that the Regional Court had wrongly considered his previous conviction as an aggravating factor and yet had chosen to regard the surrender and confession as a mitigating factor. He asked for the first\u2011instance judgment to be quashed on the grounds given in his appeal of 6 December 2004.", "40.  On the same date the applicant (through his counsel) lodged an appeal in which he insisted that the statement of surrender and confession had not been genuine as he had been forcibly brought to the police station and detained there for twelve hours with no access to a lawyer.", "41.  On 16 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the first\u2011instance judgment in a summary fashion.", "42.  The applicant further unsuccessfully sought supervisory review of his conviction.", "43.  On 5 April 2005 the applicant sent another complaint to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, which was forwarded to the town prosecutor\u2019s office.", "44.  On 12 May 2005 the deputy town prosecutor quashed the decision of 18 June 2004 and issued an instruction to carry out an additional pre\u2011investigation inquiry.", "45.  On 15 May 2005 S., an investigator with the town prosecutor\u2019s office, refused to institute an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment. He found it established that on 12 March 2004 a police officer in Naro-Fominsk had received a report of a violent fight; on 13 March 2004 he had invited the applicant to come in for a \u201cpreventative talk\u201d and had noticed two bruises under the applicant\u2019s eyes. S. concluded that the bruise under the applicant\u2019s right eye had been a result of the injury inflicted long before the arrest. He also pointed out that the Regional Court had \u201ccarefully examined\u201d the applicant\u2019s version of ill-treatment by police officers.

On the morning of the 4 July the jurors were shown a video in relation to their service and were given verbal instruction from the court\u2019s jury officer that they were not permitted to research their cases on the Internet or to research the defendants or any of the individuals involved in the trial. Notices in the jury waiting room contained the following warning:\n\u201cYou may also be in contempt of court if you use the internet to research details about any cases you hear along with any cases listed for trial at the Court ...\u201d", "9.  The notices made it clear that contempt of court was punishable by a fine or by imprisonment.", "10.  The applicant was selected to serve on a jury in a trial of a defendant charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial commenced that afternoon. When the jury were sworn, the applicant took an oath or affirmation that she would faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence.", "11.  Before the case was opened by the prosecution, the judge gave a number of directions to the jury. These underlined the importance of deciding the case only on the basis of what the jury saw and heard in the courtroom. Two consequences were identified by the judge. The first was that they should not speak about the case to anybody. He continued:\n\u201cThe second consequence is a newer one: that you do not go on the internet. You have probably read in the last few weeks about a juror who did go on the internet; went on Facebook and severe problems followed for that juror. I am sure you will not want any of those. So, the rule is \u2013 and it is told to every jury \u2013 that not only do you not discuss it, but you do not go on the internet; you do not try and do any research of your own; you do not discuss it on Facebook; you do not tweet about it; or anything of that nature. So, simply, once you leave this room you do not talk about it or deal with it in any way with anybody.\nWe ask you to observe what goes on in this room. The evidence has been carefully considered.

The trial continued on 5 and 6 July 2011. On 5 July the trial judge allowed a prosecution application to adduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s bad character. The disclosure gave details of a previous sentence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It was not disclosed that the defendant had also been charged with rape in respect of the same offence but had been acquitted.", "13.  On 6 July 2011 the jury retired to consider their verdict. At the end of the court day the judge sent the jury home to return on 8 July 2011.", "14.  After the court had risen, one of the jurors in the case informed the court usher that a juror, whom she identified as the applicant, had been on the Internet and had found out about the previous conviction and that it involved rape. The trial judge was informed.", "15.  On 8 July 2011, after hearing from the juror in court, the judge summoned the jury foreman, who confirmed that there had been some reference to the matter to which the juror had referred. The judge then called the applicant into court. He informed her of what had been said and that she should not say anything at that stage. He gave her the opportunity, which she accepted, of speaking to a barrister in order to take advice on the question of contempt of court. After discussion with the applicant, the barrister informed the court that the applicant\u2019s position was that her behaviour regarding the Internet was not deliberate. She therefore claimed to have a defence to the allegation of contempt of court. The judge explained to her that the matter would be referred to the Attorney General and that there would be a police investigation.", "16.  The judge subsequently discharged the jury and the trial was aborted.", "17.  The police obtained statements from the eleven other jurors at trial. The statements showed that during the jury deliberations the applicant stated that she had conducted Internet research and that her research had showed that the previous conviction also included an allegation of rape. Most of the other jurors had reacted to this by making it clear that the applicant had introduced extraneous and impermissible facts into their discussion, contrary to the instructions and directions that they had been given.", "18.  On 26 July 2011 the police interviewed the applicant under caution. During the interview, the applicant explained what had happened at the commencement of the trial and set out her recollection of what the trial judge had said as follows:\n\u201cThe judge said ... that we should not look, we should not publish anything on Facebook, on Twitter, we should not tell anybody outside the court about the case ...\u201d", "19.  She said that did not recall that the judge had instructed jurors not to do Internet research.", "20.  She explained that she had seen a newspaper article concerning the defendant on the Internet on the evening of 5 July 2011. When asked what she was doing on the Internet, she replied that, as she was Greek, she had wished to know the exact translation of the charge facing the defendant. She had therefore searched for \u201cgrievous bodily harm\u201d. She had then wished to see how frequent such incidents were in Luton so added \u201cLuton\u201d to the search terms. The article concerning the defendant\u2019s previous conviction had appeared in the list of results. She explained that her recollection was hazy but that she did not remember searching for the defendant by name. She admitted that she had informed the other members of the jury of the information she had found. She said that she was not aware that she had missed any element of the judge\u2019s instructions and that she had had \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of going against the instructions or directions of the judge.", "21.  The Attorney General subsequently applied to the Divisional Court for permission to make an application for an order of committal under Order 52 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (\u201cSCR\u201d \u2013 see paragraphs 45-46 below). The applicant was informed of the application by letter dated 3 November 2011.", "22.  On 29 November 2011 the Divisional Court granted permission to make a committal application.", "23.  On 2 December 2011 a claim form was issued by the Attorney General seeking an order of committal against the applicant for:\n\u201ccontempt of court in conducting Internet research on the case she was trying as a juror in the Crown Court and thereafter in disclosing the extraneous information she had obtained to other members of the jury.\u201d", "24.  The grounds on which the applicant\u2019s committal was sought were that\n\u201cher acts created a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing and/or impeding the course of justice in the proceedings with which she was concerned.\u201d", "25.  Reference was made to further details set out in a sworn affidavit by a legal adviser at the Attorney General\u2019s office. In the affidavit, it was submitted that the evidence in the case demonstrated that the applicant:\n\u201cdeliberately and in breach of instructions given by the jury officer, a warning contained in a written notice, her jury oath or affirmation and directions given by the trial judge, (a) conducted internet research on the case she was trying, and thereby obtained extraneous information about the case, and (b) imparted that extraneous information to other members of the jury whilst the jury were in deliberation.\u201d", "26.  In her position statement dated 5 December 2011, the applicant accepted that she had searched on the Internet for the words \u201cgrievous\u201d and \u201cLuton\u201d while the trial was underway and that she had discussed with other jurors a newspaper report concerning the defendant. She did not accept a specific intent to impede or to cause a real risk of prejudice to the due administration of justice.", "27.  In a note on behalf of the Attorney General dated 9 January 2012, the test for contempt was set out as follows:\n\u201cAt common law, a contempt of court is an act or omission which creates a real risk of prejudice to the administration of justice, done with the intent of creating such a risk.\u201d", "28.  The note went on to claim that the applicant\u2019s Internet research and subsequent conduct in relation to it had created a real risk of prejudice to the administration of justice and had been done with the intent of creating such a risk.", "29.  In written submissions on behalf of the applicant dated 10 January 2012, it was submitted that the offence of contempt of court could be stated as follows:\n\u201cWhere a person knowingly does an act which he specifically intends to impede, or create a real risk of prejudicing, the due administration of justice ...\u201d", "30.  On 19 January 2012 the application for committal was heard. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the key element that the prosecution had to prove was \u201cspecific intent\u201d, that is intent to impede or create a real risk of prejudicing the due administration of justice. He referred to the Attorney General\u2019s position that intent could be inferred from foresight of the consequences and indicated that, while that might be appropriate in some cases, it did not sit so easily with the kind of intent required in the applicant\u2019s case. An exchange then took place between the court and counsel for the applicant, as follows:\n\u201c[Court]:Can we get this down to the reality of the case. The Crown\u2019s case is that your client deliberately disobeyed the order of the judge. Is that not the same as what you are saying? You disagree with it and you are going to submit to us why the Crown\u2019s case is wrong, but if a juror deliberately disobeys the order if a judge, is that not contempt of court?\n[Counsel]:Certainly, yes.\n[Court]: The \u2018deliberate\u2019 is the point that matters.\n[Counsel]: Yes. Yes.\u201d", "31.  The Attorney General was subsequently asked whether he accepted that in the context of the case he had to satisfy the court, to the criminal standard, that the applicant had deliberately disobeyed the order of the judge. He confirmed that he did.", "32.  At the conclusion of the evidence and submissions, and after the court had already adjourned, the judges returned to seek further clarification of the correct test for contempt of court. The following test was put to counsel by the bench:\n\u201cIt is a contempt in the context of jury misconduct within the jury room, for a juror deliberately to disobey the direction of the judge and create a risk of prejudice to the due administration of justice.\u201d", "33.  The judge added:\n\u201cWhat that removes is a specific intent in relation to the creation of the risk. The intent is directed at the deliberate disobedience.\u201d", "34.  The Attorney General expressed himself to be content with the test proposed. Counsel for the applicant requested that the word \u201cthereby\u201d be added following \u201cdisobey the direction of the judge and ...\u201d, in order to create a link between the two elements. The Attorney General fully accepted the proposed modification. Counsel for the applicant was pressed on whether he was content with a definition whereby the intent was the deliberate act of disobeying the order, which then had a causative link in creating the risk. It was noted by the judge that this was a slightly different test from the one counsel had earlier proposed. He replied that he was content with the proposed test, and added:\n\u201cI am reacting as I stand. I hope I can venture to submit that actually, if this is the test, it is perhaps redefining an old law but it is new.\u201d", "35.  On 23 January 2012 an order for committal was made. The Divisional Court summarised the applicant\u2019s version of events as follow:\n\u201c36. On her account, effectively, she came across the newspaper reference to [the defendant\u2019s] previous conviction in the local newspaper in Luton by following a route from the word \u2018grievous\u2019 through to \u2018Luton\u2019 and \u2018crime\u2019 and in effect, somehow she stumbled across the newspaper entry.\u201d", "36.  However, the court rejected her account, explaining:\n\u201c37. We do not believe that the defendant did not seek information about [the defendant] on the internet. Her inability to remember this particular feature of the case, when she has a detailed recollection of so much else, was not credible. We do not believe that she could have just stumbled across the link to [the defendant\u2019s] previous conviction in the way she described.\u201d", "37.  The court concluded:\n\u201c38. We have no doubt that the defendant knew perfectly well, first, that the judge had directed her, and the other members of the jury, in unequivocal terms, that they should not seek information about the case from the internet; second, that the defendant appreciated that this was an order; and, third, that the defendant deliberately disobeyed the order. By doing so, before she made any disclosure to her fellow jurors, she did not merely risk prejudice to the due administration of justice, but she caused prejudice to it. This was because she had sought to arm and had armed herself with information of possible relevance to the trial which, although not adduced in evidence, might have played its part in her verdict. The moment when she disclosed any of that information to her fellow jurors she further prejudiced the administration of justice. In the result, the jury was rightly discharged from returning a verdict and a new trial was ordered. The unfortunate complainant had to give evidence of his ordeal on a second occasion. The time of the other members of the jury was wasted, and the public was put to additional unnecessary expense. The damage to the administration of justice is obvious.\u201d", "38.  It found that the contempt had been proved to the criminal standard. On sentence, the court explained that misuse of the Internet by a juror was always \u201ca most serious irregularity\u201d and that an effective custodial sentence was virtually inevitable to ensure that the integrity of the process of trial by jury was sustained. A sentence of imprisonment for six months was imposed. The judge noted that pursuant to rules on early release, the applicant would serve three months in prison.", "39.  Following the handing down of the judgment, an exchange took place between the applicant\u2019s counsel and the bench. The applicant\u2019s counsel sought clarity on the test for contempt of court, explaining:\n\u201cI am concerned that the test that I was addressing \u2013 that we were addressing in preparation of this case \u2013 was a different test. We conducted the defence to a different test, and the reasons why it was a different test, I suggest, are threefold. First, the intention is different. Secondly, the risk has been diluted from \u2018real risk\u2019 \u2013 and, after all, \u2018risk\u2019 on the authorities simply means \u2018a possibility of occurrence\u2019 to \u2018risk\u2019. Thirdly, may I make this submission? This is the first occasion \u2013 I do this with some hesitation for I can find no authority \u2013 where there has been a contempt of court flowing from a judicial direction.\n... It has always historically been the order which has attracted contempt, not the direction, and the idea that a judge gives directions to a jury in the summing-up which could attract contempt and imprisonment is, in my submission, a novel one.\nI therefore submit this question rhetorically: whether this reformulation that this court has applied in this case is consistent with the common law of contempt.\u201d", "40.  The court retired to consider the matter before confirming that the appropriate test was applied in paragraph 38 of its judgment (see paragraph 37 above), and that it had been understood that applicant\u2019s counsel had agreed to that test. Leave to appeal was refused.", "41.  The applicant applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. She argued, inter alia, that the test of contempt of court reformulated by the Divisional Court was not consistent with the common law of contempt of court; and that the reformulation of the offence, after evidence had been led and final submissions concluded, was not compatible with human rights principles and in particular with Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention.", "42.  On 26 January 2012 the applicant\u2019s petition to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused because the application did not raise an arguable point of law. In particular, the Supreme Court concluded that a suggested distinction between a \u201cdirection\u201d and an \u201corder\u201d was not tenable since the meaning of each depended on the context and both could mean the same; and that the deliberate disobedience of a specific order of the judge not to use the Internet in connection with the case unquestionably amounted to contempt of court at common law.", "43.  From 23 January 2012 to 20 April 2012 the applicant was detained at HMP Holloway."], "applicants": ["DALLAS"], "defendants": ["UNITED KINGDOM"], "allegedly_violated_articles": ["7"], "violated_articles": [], "court_assessment_references": {"7": ["10", "11", "27", "29", "30", "31", "32", "33", "34", "37", "39", "42", "47", "50", "51", "52", "53", "54", "8", "9"]}, "silver_rationales": [2, 3, 4, 5, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33, 36], "gold_rationales": []}

The applicants were born in 1983 and 2007 respectively and live in Gevgelija, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.", "7.  On 15 October 2006 the first applicant married Mr V. Savik (\u201cthe father\u201d). On 11 February 2007 she gave birth to their daughter, the second applicant.", "8.  On 10 May 2007 the Gevgelija Court of First Instance (\u201cthe first-instance court\u201d) dissolved the marriage and gave the first applicant custody of the second applicant.", "9.  On 31 May 2007, on an application by the father, the Gevgelija Social Welfare Centre (\u201cthe Centre\u201d) made an order specifying that he could see the second applicant at the first applicant\u2019s house every Friday for two hours. The order was made after the Centre had examined the situation in both families and had discussed the matter with the parents. \u0422he order was served on the first applicant on 2 June 2007.", "10.  The first applicant\u2019s refusal to allow the father to have contact with the second applicant at four scheduled meetings between 8 and 29 June 2007 led to her being convicted pursuant to Article 198 of the Criminal Code (judgment K.br.133/07 of 2 July 2007). The court, noting the child\u2019s young age, dismissed the first applicant\u2019s defence (that she had not been consulted and notified about the Centre\u2019s order of 31 May 2007; that the child had not been developing properly at the time; and that the father had not shown any interest for the child) and sentenced her to six months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for one year. In determining the penalty, the court referred to gravity of the crime and the manner in which it had been committed, as aggravating circumstances, as well as to the first applicant\u2019s age, her admitting to the crime, the fact that she had no previous criminal record, her good behaviour and her family situation, as mitigating factors. According to the court, the suspended prison term would deter her from reoffending and help crime prevention as a whole. The judgment was upheld on appeal on 27 December 2007.", "11.  A further refusal by the first applicant to comply with the Centre\u2019s order of 31 May 2007 by not allowing the father to have contact with the second applicant between July and October 2007 resulted in her being convicted a second time and being given a further suspended prison sentence (eight months, suspended for two years, judgment K.br.229/07 of 17 December 2007, upheld on appeal on 14 May 2008). The first applicant was also ordered to allow the father to see the child within 30 days after the judgment would become final. In case of non-compliance, the court specified that the suspension would be revoked and the sentence would be enforced. The court dismissed the first applicant\u2019s defence that the father had failed to observe the scheduled meeting times, that he had turned up instead under the influence of alcohol and drugs and that he had harassed her, her parents and the child. In determining the penalty, the court referred, inter alia, to the first applicant\u2019s age and her standard of living, as mitigating factors. Both judgments (K.br.133/07 and K.br.229/07) were delivered after the court had heard oral evidence from the first applicant, the father and a representative of the Centre. They were given by Judge I.S. of the Gevgelija Court of First Instance.", "12.  In the meantime, on 21 November 2007, the Centre set a new venue and time for the meetings between the father and the second applicant. It was decided to increase the time to five hours every Friday and for the meetings to take place at the Centre rather than in the first applicant\u2019s house. According to the order, the father\u2019s right to have contact with the second applicant, as specified in the order of 31 May 2007, had been considerably affected by the strained relationship between him and the first applicant. The new arrangement required the first applicant to take the second applicant to the Centre at a specified time each week. The Centre stated, inter alia, that:\n\u201c... According to the established methodology of work, all efforts have been made for communication to be established between both parents, between the competent body and [the first applicant] and the parents have been alerted to all legal consequences should they fail to enforce their statutory duties as parents that can violate the rights of the minor child.\nAfter actions have been taken and facts have been established ... on a meeting held on 12 November 2007 the expert team found that no communication could yet be established with [the first applicant] and the parents could not agree on [the second applicant\u2019s] right to have regular contacts and meetings with the non-cohabitant parent. Such an attitude infringes the right of the minor S. Therefore, given [the second applicant\u2019s] age, the need for an emotional bond to be created between the minor child and the non-cohabitant parent, the need to protect her rights, as well (the need) to eliminate any possibility for manipulation that would prevent the expert team to supervise the enforcement of the contact arrangements between the minor child and the father, (the Centre) decided the father\u2019s visiting rights in respect of the minor S.S...\u201d.", "13.  The first applicant failed to appear at three scheduled meetings in November and December 2007. On two occasions in January and March 2008, the father did not see his daughter because she was ill.", "14.  On 29 April 2008, after the Centre had obtained the views of the first applicant and the father and had examined the file, it partially accepted the father\u2019s request for longer and more frequent meetings and issued an order (no. 12-07/33), specifying that his meetings with the second applicant were to take place in the Centre every Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The order further stated that:\n\u201c... The expert team (notes that) the minor S. is still breast-fed, but (since) it is necessary to further strengthen the [child\u2019s] emotional bond with the non-cohabitant parent and to protect the right of [the second applicant] to have contact with the father, it considers that the visiting rights should remain once a week, but longer, which would enable that (the child) stays overnight after she would no longer be breast-fed.\u201d", "15.  The Centre further set two dates on which the father could meet the second applicant, to replace the meetings missed in January and March 2008 (see paragraph 13 above). The first applicant was ordered to comply with the new contact arrangements or risk criminal proceedings being instituted against her and the father being given temporary custody of the second applicant.", "16.  As the first applicant failed to comply in full with the order of 29 April 2008, on 28 May 2008 the Centre allowed the order of 29 April 2008 to be enforced by means of a separate order issued under section 14 of the Family Act (see paragraph 46 below). It established that the first applicant had failed to take the child to four of the scheduled meetings, despite being warned of the possible consequences should she fail to comply. The order further stated that:\n\u201c... Such a warning did not, for unknown reasons, enable the minor S.S. to enjoy the statutory right to contact her father and the mother not only ignores the order, but also engages in unreasonable and constant correspondence to describe incomprehensible situations, and makes accusations in a confused manner about matters which are the subject of other proceedings.\nIn view of the above and by virtue of law, the expert team ... decided unanimously that there are statutory grounds for forceful enforcement of the executive order of 29 April 2008 ... and for proceedings to be instituted regarding custody of the child and criminal liability of [the first applicant].\nIn view of the above and the fact that (the case concerns) the forceful prevention by [the first applicant] of contacts between minor S.S. and her father V.S. ...the expert team considers that the forceful enforcement (of the order of 29 April 2008) as specified in (this decision) is in the absolute interest of the minor [second applicant] ...\u201d", "17.  The first applicant was ordered to take the second applicant to the Centre on 2 June 2008 or risk being prosecuted for child abduction under Article 198 of the Criminal Code. The order stated that an appeal would not suspend enforcement of the order (\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0442\u043e). The first applicant confirmed that she had received the enforcement order of 28 May 2008. She appealed against that order, arguing that she had never been served with the Centre\u2019s order of 29 April 2008. Furthermore, she argued that the delivery that she had received by post on 2 May 2008 had not contained the order of 29 April 2008. No decision on the appeal was made.", "18.  On 17 June 2008 the first applicant asked the Centre to review the level of contact the father should have with the child. On 24 December 2008, the Centre made an order setting out the level of contact the father should have with the child. It appears that the first applicant complied with this order.", "19.  On an unspecified date, the father requested that the Centre review the level of contact with the second applicant. The first applicant failed to appear at the Centre to discuss the father\u2019s request, notwithstanding that the Centre invited her to do so at two occasions. On 3 June 2009 the Centre made an order specifying that the father should meet his daughter every Monday to Tuesday (from 9 a.m. to 9 a.m.). The increased amount of contact was justified by the child\u2019s \u201cspecific age and stage of development ... when a stable relationship (with the father), as well as an emotional bond between them, were necessary for [the child\u2019s] proper mental and physical development\u201d.", "20. Subsequent to the two judgments against her of 2 July and 17 December 2007 (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above), on 19 June 2008, the public prosecutor brought criminal charges against the first applicant. She was accused of failing to allow the meeting scheduled for 2 June 2008 to take place, as required by the Centre\u2019s orders of 29 April and 28 May 2008. In submissions of 30 June 2008, the first applicant denied the charge, arguing that she had never been served with the Centre\u2019s order of 29 April 2008. In this connection, she maintained that she had received another order from the Centre dated 30 April 2008. She also expressed concerns about the fairness of the upcoming trial, given her Bulgarian nationality. She further applied for the removal of Judge I.S., should he be assigned to decide the case. On 1 July 2008 her application was dismissed by \u201ca judge replacing the president\u201d of the first-instance court. In submissions of 7 July 2008 to the first-instance court, the first applicant repeated her arguments and explained that she had sought Judge I.S.\u2019s removal because he had convicted her in the previous criminal cases brought against her. She also maintained that he had allegedly solicited sexual favours from her. Her criminal complaint on the latter subject had allegedly been rejected by the same public prosecutor who had indicted her in the impugned proceedings. She also alleged that the judge who had replaced the president of the first-instance court, and who had dismissed her application for the removal of Judge I.S., was a relative of hers who, in discussions with her, had expressed disagreement with a decision she had made to study in Bulgaria.", "21.  The first applicant decided not to testify at the hearing held on 10 July 2008. The first-instance court heard the father, who stated that for reasons unknown to him he had not seen his daughter at any of the scheduled meetings since 29 April 2008. A representative of the Centre stated that the first applicant had not complied with its orders of 29 April and 28 May 2008, notwithstanding the fact that she had been informed of the consequences of non-compliance. She confirmed that the first applicant had been served with all the relevant orders the Centre had made. In a judgment of the same date the first-instance court, presided over by Judge I.S., found the first applicant guilty and sentenced her to three months in prison. In doing so, it relied on the oral and documentary evidence admitted at the trial, including the Centre\u2019s orders of 29 April and 28 May 2008, which had provided explicitly for the need of the child to \u201cstrengthen the emotional bond with the [father] and to protect [her] right to have contact with [him]\u201d as being \u201cin [the child\u2019s] absolute interest\u201d. The court established that the first applicant had not complied with these orders notwithstanding that she had been alerted about the consequences for non-compliance. She had not allowed the father to see his daughter on several occasions before and after 2 June 2008, the date specified in the enforcement order of 28 May 2008. The court further stated that it could not assess the first applicant\u2019s defence due to the fact that she had remained silent at the trial and provided no arguments regarding the incident. Lastly, it stated that:\n\u201cIn assessing the severity of the sentence, the court took into consideration all relevant circumstances (aggravating and mitigating factors) ... in particular, the gravity of the charges and concrete consequences, the manner in which the crime had been committed, the fact that [the first applicant] had already been convicted of the same offence on 2 July [judgment K.br.133/07] and 17 December 2007 [judgment K.br.229/07] and [sentenced to an alternative penalty-suspended prison term]. The court found no alleviating circumstances related to the [first applicant].\nThe above stated leads to a conclusion that the suspended prison sentences issued against the [first applicant] had no impact on her, [given that the first applicant] continues committing the same offence. Accordingly, it decided to sentence her to a prison term finding that it would ... deter her from reoffending in the future and would [help crime prevention as a whole].", "22.  The first applicant appealed. On 3 December 2008 the Skopje Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment. It held that the first-instance court had correctly established that she had not complied with the Centre\u2019s orders of 29 April and 28 May 2008. Lastly, it endorsed the reasons of the first-instance court regarding her custodial sentence.", "23.  On 18 February 2009 the first applicant applied to the Supreme Court for an extraordinary review of the final judgment, reiterating the arguments she had raised in her appeal. On 5 May 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed her application, finding that the facts, as based on the evidence admitted at the trial, had been correctly established by the lower courts. In this connection, the lower courts had correctly applied the procedural rules and based their judgments on evidence admitted at the trial. Lastly, the court endorsed the reasons given by the lower courts.", "24.  The first applicant was ordered to present herself at prison on 10 March 2009. On 13 March 2009 the first-instance court postponed the execution of the sentence because the second applicant was ill and a new date was set for 14 June 2009. The first applicant started serving her sentence on 30 July 2009, and was released on 8 October 2009.", "25.  On 9 July 2009 the Centre gave the father custody of the second applicant for fifteen days.", "26.  On 30 July 2009, the date when the first applicant started serving the sentence, the Centre gave the father, of its own motion and on the basis of section 87(6) of the Family Act (see paragraph 54 below), temporary custody of the second applicant pending the conclusion of custody proceedings which he had initiated in August 2008 (see paragraph 33 below). According to the order, the first applicant had not allowed the second applicant to have any contact with the father at any of the scheduled meetings since 15 June 2009. After that date, the applicants had gone into hiding, despite the second applicant\u2019s poor health, which required continuous medical supervision. The order further referred to the first applicant\u2019s incarceration. The order did not provide for any contact rights for the first applicant in respect of the second applicant.", "27.  On 6 October 2009 the first applicant sought permission from the Centre to see the second applicant. According to the Government, the Centre invited her to an interview upon her release from prison. However, it appears that she did not receive the invitation and, accordingly, failed to appear.", "28.  According to the first applicant, on 23 November 2009 a lawyer acting on her behalf contacted the Centre to find out the whereabouts of her daughter and it was allegedly on that occasion that she was given the Centre\u2019s order of 30 July 2009 (see paragraph 26 above). The lawyer allegedly requested the Centre to decide the contact arrangements between the first and second applicants, which the Centre refused to do, as under the law such orders were only made after both parents had been interviewed by the Centre\u2019s welfare officers.", "29.  On 4 January 2010 the first applicant again requested that the Centre specify her contact rights. In reply, the Centre twice asked the first applicant to specify a time and place for meeting her daughter. The first applicant refused to be served with these notifications.", "30.  According to the Government, on 29 January 2010 the first applicant applied to the first-instance court for a decision on the amount of contact she could have with her daughter. Since she had specified a time and place for her contact with the daughter, the Centre, in an order dated 10 February 2010, specified her contact rights, which were to be every Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.", "31.  On 19 February 2010 the first applicant met her daughter.", "32.  On an application lodged by the first applicant, on 5 March 2010, the order of 10 February 2010 was replaced by a new order by the Centre, dated 17 March 2010, according to which the first applicant was allowed to stay with the second applicant every second weekend in the month, from Friday (3 p.m.) to Monday (9 a.m.).", "33.  On 26 August 2008 the father initiated custody proceedings, seeking to have the first-instance court amend its judgment of 10 May 2007 (see paragraph 8 above) and give him custody of the second applicant. In a judgment of 11 March 2010, the court granted his application and ordered the first applicant to hand the child over to the father. The first applicant would be allowed to maintain personal and direct contact with her. On 20 May 2010, however, the judgment was set aside by the Skopje Court of Appeal, which remitted the case for a fresh examination. The Court of Appeal ordered the first-instance court to reassess the available evidence and provide convincing reasons why the first applicant was unfit to enjoy custody of the child.", "34.  On 15 October 2010 the first-instance court dismissed the father\u2019s application after hearing evidence from him and the first applicant and admitting expert opinions, of 25 August 2009 and 5 February 2010, which confirmed that both parents were mentally fit and had the required capacity to care for the child. It also admitted a report by the Centre, dated 24 September 2009, in which welfare officers confirmed that the first applicant had the necessary capacity to provide basic care for the child, but that she had continuously prevented her from seeing the father. They had not applied to a court to have her parental rights restricted since there were other ways to protect the interests and rights of the child. They further argued that the first applicant\u2019s behaviour had been inappropriate: she had used insulting language towards everyone involved in the case, and had portrayed herself, without any justification, as a victim of the system. According to the experts, this was not a suitable environment for the second applicant. On the basis of all the available information, the Centre\u2019s welfare officers suggested that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests for the father to be given custody. In that way the child could maintain a relationship with both parents, which she had been unable to do when the first applicant had had custody.", "35.  Referring to the aforementioned facts, (see paragraphs 7-32 above), the court found that the first applicant had, for a protracted period of time, prevented the father from having contact with his daughter at the scheduled meetings. She had not been cooperative or shown any insight in her dealings with the State authorities, unlike the father, whose behaviour had been of no concern. Her past behaviour had been the result of her lack of trust in the authorities and her strained relationship with the father, but this had not affected her ability to care for the child. In this connection, the court stated:\n\u201cThe court took into consideration the [Centre\u2019s welfare officers\u2019] opinion, but it has found that it would be in the best interests of the child, given the child\u2019s (young) age and current stage of her development, for her to remain in the custody of the mother. The father may maintain a personal relationship and direct contact with the child. The court also took into consideration the fact that, as a consequence of these proceedings, the parties have understood the need for mutual communication in order to ensure the rights of the child. They ... have reached an agreement regarding their right to have contact with the child, which reduces the need for the competent body to determine those relationships ... In this connection, there is always the possibility that the parents reach their own agreement, at any given time, regarding custody of the child, as befits her interests.\u201d", "36.  Lastly, the court concluded that the first applicant\u2019s nationality was of no relevance to the case. On 3 February 2011 the Skopje Court of Appeal upheld the judgment.", "37.  After the judgment became final, on 7 March 2011 the Centre specified the contact rights of the father and allowed him to meet his daughter on the second and fourth weekend of the month, between Friday (3 p.m.) and Monday (9 a.m.).", "38.  On 1 March 2012 the Supreme Court upheld an appeal on points of law (\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430) by the father, finding that there had been a \u201cwrongful application of the substantive law given the established facts\u201d (\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e, \u0430\u043a\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430). The court overturned the lower courts\u2019 judgments and gave custody of the second applicant to the father. The first applicant was further ordered to pay maintenance of 2,000 Macedonian denars (approximately 30 euros) per month. Referring to the first applicant\u2019s non-compliance with the Centre\u2019s orders of 31 May and 21 November 2007, the fact that she had been convicted on three occasions, as well as to the Centre\u2019s expert opinion, as \u201cthe competent and responsible body\u201d (\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d), the court held that there were grounds to amend the first-instance court\u2019s order of 10 May 2007 regarding custody of the child. Relying on sections 8, 45, 47, 76 and 80 of the Family Act (see paragraphs 45-52 below) the Supreme Court stated, inter alia:\n\u201cThis court considers that after [the first-instance court\u2019s] judgment of 10 May 2007, which granted [the first applicant] custody of [the second applicant], the child was deprived of the fundamental right to receive parental care from both parents because of the first applicant alone. That is the fundamental, most important and decisive reason for amending the judgment [of 10 May 2007] (and) granting the [father] custody of the minor [the second applicant]. The court notes that the lower courts disregarded the change in circumstances and the Centre\u2019s expert opinion, without any legally justified and reasonable grounds. This court considers, contrary to the findings of the lower courts, that ... it is in the best interests of the minor, S., with a view to her enjoying the company of both parents, and ensuring her development, that [the father] should be given custody. His past behaviour has shown that he is a constructive and cooperative parent whose main concern is the interests of the minor, S.\nThis court further considers that the reason why the lower courts dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim to have custody of [the second applicant], namely that she was three years and eight months old and that at that age she needed to stay with the mother, with whom she was biologically connected, cannot be regarded as the only relevant legal ground (\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430). The child\u2019s age is an important ground, but it is not the only [element] which is decisive for the court. A court order determining which of the parents of a minor child should be given custody is dependent on other factors, such as the parents\u2019 personalities; their views regarding their rights and duties in respect of their child; the rights and interests of the child, including, certainly, [the child\u2019s] right to both parents; and the need for the child to have the best environment for [his or her] healthy mental and physical development. In the present case, and having regard to all the circumstances, not only the [second applicant\u2019s] age, a final conclusion can be drawn that it is in the [child\u2019s] interests, and best for her mental and physical development, that [the father] should have custody rights.\u201d", "39.  The applicant was served with the judgment on 18 June 2012.", "40.  On an application by the first applicant, on 12 July 2012 the Centre specified how much contact she could have with her daughter. According to the order, which was based on the explicit consent of both parents, the first applicant was to live with the second applicant between Monday and Friday. Both parents were allowed a ten-day summer holiday and a five-day winter holiday with her. The order further specified who would stay with the child on religious and family holidays.", "41.  On an unspecified date, the first applicant applied to the first-instance court for custody of the second applicant. The first-instance court accepted the application and granted custody to the first applicant. On 13 March 2014 that judgment was set aside. The custody proceedings are allegedly still pending before the first-instance court.", "42.  While the custody proceedings were pending, on 10 June 2013 the father applied to the Centre to change the living arrangements to allow him to live permanently with the second applicant. The mother would have the child two weekends a month. By a decision of 3 July 2013, the Centre suspended the proceedings relating to that application until the custody proceedings launched by the first applicant had been completed.", "43.

The applicant was brought before the Sumgait City Court on the day of his arrest.", "48.  According to the applicant, he was not given an opportunity to hire a lawyer of his own choice to represent him at the hearing, which began at 4 p.m. He asked the judge to postpone the examination of the case for one hour so that his lawyer could arrive at the court. However, the judge decided to adjourn the hearing for only thirty minutes and to recommence the hearing at 4.30 p.m., which was not enough time for the applicant\u2019s lawyer to arrive.", "49.  According to the transcript of the court hearing, the applicant refused the assistance of a State-funded lawyer.", "50.  The applicant stated before the court that he was not guilty of breaching public order by swearing at the location indicated by the police, and that he believed that the motive for his arrest had been his participation in the demonstration of 12 March 2011.", "51.  The only witnesses questioned during the court hearing were police officers M.N., R.S. and A.M. They testified that the applicant had been swearing without addressing anyone in particular and that they had therefore taken him to a police station.", "52.  The court found that the applicant had committed an administrative offence under Article 296 of the CAO and sentenced him to seven days\u2019 \u201cadministrative\u201d detention.", "53.  The applicant lodged an appeal before the Sumgait Court of Appeal, presenting his version of the facts surrounding the arrest, and arguing that his arrest had been unlawful and that the hearing before the first-instance court had not been fair. He urged the Sumgait Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance court\u2019s decision.", "54.  It appears that the applicant prepared his written appeal with the assistance of a lawyer of his own choice. However, he participated in the hearing before the Sumgait Court of Appeal without his lawyer.", "55.

On 29 December 2009 the Shevchenkivskyy District Court (\u201cthe Shevchenkivskyy Court\u201d) remanded him in custody pending trial.", "9.  On 30 December 2009 K. was placed in the Kyiv Pre-Trial Detention Centre (\u201cthe SIZO\u201d).", "10.  On 22 March 2010 he complained to the court that the investigator had subjected him to physical and psychological pressure in order to make him confess to a crime which he had not committed. His complaint was referred to the Shevchenkivskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d).", "11.  At 9.30 a.m. on 10 April 2010 K. was admitted to Kyiv City Emergency Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a closed abdominal injury, rupture of the spleen, retroperitoneal haematoma, a closed chest injury, laceration (tissue rupture) of the right lung, left-sided pneumonia, post-traumatic anaemia, and fourth-degree haemorrhagic shock (the most serious on a scale of one to four, entailing critical blood loss of over 40%).", "12.

On 28 April 2010 K. was discharged from hospital and placed in the SIZO\u2019s medical unit, where he remained until 18 June 2010.", "16.  On 3 June 2010 the Kyiv City Police Department completed the internal investigation in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint regarding the alleged ill-treatment of her son and found it to be without any basis.", "17.  On 8 June 2010 the newspaper \u201cSegodnya\u201d, issued in the Kyiv region, published an article under the headline \u201cA bad [police] station\u201d (\u00ab\u041d\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u00bb) about the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant\u2019s son in the Shevchenkivskyy police station in spring 2010. The author relied, in particular, on the statements of one of K.\u2019s cell-mates. A similar article titled \u201cAnother incident in the Shevchenkivskyy police station\u201d (\u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0427\u041f \u0432 \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0420\u0423\u0412\u0414\u00bb) appeared in the internet media outlet \u201cLevyy Bereg\u201d.", "18.  On 10 June 2010 the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office overruled its decision of 23 April 2010 and decided that further investigation was required. More specifically, K. had to be questioned as to who exactly had subjected him to ill-treatment in the SIZO in April 2010.", "19.  On 10 June 2010 the investigator also questioned the applicant\u2019s son. K. contended that on 26 December 2009, when he was arrested, police officers had hit him in the stomach. He further stated that the investigator dealing with his case had also hit him in the stomach once in March 2010. According to K., these two beatings had necessitated his urgent medical treatment on 10 April 2010. K. said that he did not understand why his mother had stated that he had been subjected to ill-treatment on 8 April 2010 (see paragraph 13 above).", "20.  On 21 June 2010 the investigator who was in charge of K.\u2019s criminal case was also questioned. He denied ever having seen K. in March 2010, let alone having physically assaulted him.", "21.  On 8 July 2010 the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office once again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers in question, having found no evidence of criminal conduct. The decision not to prosecute noted that K. had not complained of any ill-treatment during his detention, and that his medical examination on 27 December 2009 had not revealed any injuries (see paragraph 7 above). Following his hospitalisation on 10 April 2010, K. had mentioned to a doctor that he had been physically assaulted some three days earlier, and the doctor had then stated to the investigator that K.\u2019s injuries had been sustained no more than two days before his admission to hospital. According to his medical file, K.\u2019s injuries had originated from blows to his back with blunt objects one to twelve hours prior to his admission to hospital (that is, during the night of 9 to 10 April 2010). On the basis of the above information, the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office concluded that the allegation regarding K.\u2019s ill\u2011treatment was unsubstantiated.", "22.  On 3 August 2010 an official of the Kyiv City Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d), to which the investigation had been transferred meanwhile for an unknown reason, also questioned K. This time, he stated that he had only been ill-treated on 26 December 2009, but never thereafter.", "23.  On 25 August 2010 eleven inmates with whom K. had shared a cell in the SIZO were also questioned. They said that he had felt unwell on the night of 9 to 10 April 2010, and that an ambulance had been called for him on the morning of 10 April 2010. They also submitted that nobody had been violent towards him or had put him under any psychological pressure.", "24.  On 9 September 2010 the SIZO\u2019s medical assistant (\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0448\u0435\u0440), who had been on duty at the time of the events, was questioned as part of the investigation. He stated that he had been called to cell no. 36, where K. had been held, at 8.45 a.m. on 10 April 2010. K. had complained of weakness, vertigo and blurred vision. He had not alleged any ill-treatment and a visual examination had not revealed any injuries. He had had low blood pressure. The medical assistant said that he had provided K. with the necessary medical assistance and had reported the matter to the doctor on duty. The doctor on duty at the time of the events made a similar statement.", "25.  On 22 October 2010 an official from the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office questioned the ambulance paramedics who had been called to assist K. They did not remember the circumstances.", "26.  On 4 November 2010 the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office questioned K. again. He stated that Shevchenkivskyy police officers had physically assaulted him following his arrest on 26 December 2009. He considered that the sudden deterioration in his health on 10 April 2010 had been the consequence of that ill-treatment.", "27.  From 8 November 2010 to 28 January 2011 a forensic medical expert evaluation of K.\u2019s medical file was carried out, with a view to clarifying exactly how and when he had sustained his injuries and how serious those injuries had been. The expert concluded that K. had sustained an insignificant spleen trauma about a month prior to undergoing surgery, on around 10 March 2010. More specifically, he had sustained a splenic parenchyma rupture which had presented no major danger and would have healed normally. However, about twelve hours before surgery (at about 4 a.m. on 10 April 2010) K. had sustained a serious non-penetrating stomach injury resulting from a blow to the left side of his back with a blunt object. As a result, he had sustained a haemoperitoneum, a partial rupture of the diaphragm and trauma of the spleen.", "28.  On 29 December 2010 the applicant\u2019s son signed a form of authority, authorising Mr Zarutskyy (the lawyer who represented the applicant before the Court \u2013 see paragraph 2 above) to represent him in proceedings before the Court. He did not, however, lodge an application with the Court on that occasion. According to the applicant, her son did intend to lodge an application regarding both his ill-treatment and the investigation into that allegation.", "29.  In February 2011 K.\u2019s lawyer challenged the refusal to institute criminal proceedings of 8 July 2010 (see paragraph 21 above) with the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office and before the Shevchenkivskyy Court. He submitted, in particular, that the origin of K.\u2019s injuries while he had been under the authorities\u2019 control had never been explained.", "30.  On 10 March 2011 the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office, relying on the findings of the forensic medical expert report of 28 January 2011 (see paragraph 26 above), opened a criminal case in respect of unidentified individuals who had caused K. grievous bodily harm. The investigation was entrusted to the Shevchenkivskyy Police Department.", "31.  On 7 July 2011 the Shevchenkivskyy Court quashed the decision of the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office of 8 July 2010 and remitted the case for additional investigation.", "32.  Between 31 May and 25 August 2011 another forensic medical expert evaluation was carried out. It confirmed the findings of the earlier expert report of 28 January 2011 (see paragraph 27 above), but added that a fall could not be ruled out as a possible cause of the injuries.", "33.  On 26 August 2011 the Shevchenkivskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued another refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers in question for lack of corpus delicti in their actions.", "34.  On 30 September 2011 K. was assigned victim status in the criminal investigation launched on 10 March 2011. On the same date the investigator of the Shevchenkivskyy Police Department questioned him. K. maintained his earlier version of events, namely that his ill-treatment had consisted of the following two episodes: Shevchenkivskyy police officers physically assaulting him following his arrest on 26 December 2009, and the investigator in charge hitting him once in the stomach at the end of March 2010.", "35.  On 30 September 2011 the SIZO administration sent to the investigator the list of the staff members who had been on duty during the night of 9 to 10 April 2010. As regards the list of K.\u2019s cell-mates at the time, the administration informed the investigator that no records were kept in that regard.", "36.  On 7 November 2011 K., who had been transferred from the SIZO to a civilian hospital and who was suffering from HIV, tuberculosis and a number of concomitant diseases, died (see paragraphs 43-51 below).", "37.  On an unspecified date in November 2011 the applicant was granted status as K.\u2019s successor in the criminal investigation into his ill-treatment. She was represented by the same lawyer who had earlier represented K.", "38.  On 9 December 2011 the Chief of the Shevchenkivskyy Police Department informed the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the investigation, which had been initiated on 10 March 2011 (see paragraph 30 above), was ongoing.", "39.  On 30 March 2012 the applicant enquired with the Shevchenkivskyy Police Department about the progress of the investigation.", "40.  On 31 July 2012 the Kyiv City Investigation Department informed her that the investigator in charge had been disciplined for his failure to respond to the above inquiry.", "41.  It is not clear whether any investigative measures were implemented between 2012 and 2014.", "42.  On 7 March 2014 the investigator of the Shevchenkivskyy Police Department made an entry in the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations about the assault on K. causing grievous bodily harm. That constituted a new procedure for initiating a pre-trial investigation under the new Code of Criminal Procedure with effect from 19 November 2012.", "43.  Between 14 and 17 May, and 18 and 23 June 2010, when he was a detainee in the SIZO, K. was examined at the Kyiv City AIDS Centre at his request. He tested positive for HIV on both occasions.", "44.  According to the information submitted by the Government, between 24 June 2010 and 20 April 2011 K.\u2019s health remained stable and he did not seek medical assistance.", "45.  On 20 April 2011 K. had his lungs X-rayed and was diagnosed, for the first time, with tuberculosis of the right lung. It was unclear how advanced the tuberculosis was. According to the Government, he was prescribed preventive treatment for two to three months.", "46.  On 23 May 2011 K.\u2019s lawyer enquired with the management of the SIZO about his client\u2019s condition. He asked, in particular, for clarification as to whether K. had been diagnosed with tuberculosis while in detention, and requested copies of the relevant documents.", "47.  On 8 June 2011 the SIZO deputy governor and the chief of the medical unit replied that, following a planned X-ray that day, K. had been diagnosed with infiltrative tuberculosis of the right lung and had been transferred to the SIZO\u2019s medical unit for treatment. In another letter (dated 28 November 2011) from the SIZO management to the applicant\u2019s lawyer (see also paragraph 52 below), it was stated that on 8 June 2011 K. was also diagnosed as having HIV, chronic gastritis, hepatitis in remission and a drug addiction. In addition, he was classed as being in recovery following the removal of his spleen.", "48.  According to an extract from K.\u2019s medical records, he was examined repeatedly by the SIZO\u2019s doctors between June and October 2011. Each record begins with the statement that K.\u2019s complaints remained the same, without specifying of what he complained. The records of 28 July and 9 September 2011 further note that K. complained of weakness. Furthermore, it was recorded that K. had complained of periodic coughing with purulent sputum during his examinations on 7 July and 15 October 2011. From 18 October 2011 onwards a deterioration in K.\u2019s health was noted. On 20 October 2011 an ambulance was called for him.", "49.  As indicated in the letter sent by the SIZO management on 28 November 2011 in reply to the applicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s inquiry of 13 October 2011, K. had an X-ray which revealed that the treatment of his tuberculosis was evolving positively. A decision was made to continue that treatment.", "50.  On 20 October 2011 K. was taken to Kyiv City Hospital no. 5, where the following diagnoses were made: infiltrative tuberculosis of the right lung, HIV in an unclear phase, meningitis caused by HIV, chronic hepatitis and gastritis in remission. K. was also classed as being in recovery following the removal of his spleen.", "51.  On 7 November 2011 K. died in the hospital.", "52.  In a letter of 28 November 2011 to the applicant\u2019s lawyer the SIZO management noted that they had previously asked the Kyiv City Court of Appeal, which was dealing with the criminal case against K., to either accelerate the examination of that case or release K. on health grounds. However, they had not received any reply.", "53.  On 8 November 2011 the investigator of the Svyatoshynskyy District Police Department inspected K.\u2019s body in the hospital. According to the report on \u201cthe inspection of the scene of the incident\u201d, there was no indication of a violent death.", "54.  On the same date, the applicant asked the police to transfer the body to a mortuary, with a view to establishing the cause of death.", "55.  According to K.\u2019s death certificate, which was issued on 10 November 2011, his death had been caused by acute heart failure, HIV and multiple concomitant illnesses.", "56.  The autopsy report, which was also issued on 10 November 2011, specified that the immediate causes of death had been a brain tumour, pulmonary and heart failure resulting from \u201cexpress autointoxication following cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, macrofocal overwhelming subtotal bilateral pneumonia and focal pulmonary tuberculosis of a person suffering from HIV and drug addiction\u201d. The report also noted that K. had had \u201cshock kidneys\u201d, cachexia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and albuminous degeneration of the tissues of the kidneys, cardiac muscle and liver.", "57.  The applicant made a complaint to the prosecuting authorities regarding her son\u2019s premature death and requested an investigation.", "58.  On 16 November 2011 the Svyatoshynskyy District Police Department refused to open a criminal investigation into the matter, having concluded that there was no indication of a criminal offence.", "59.  On 23 December 2011 the Svyatoshynskyy District Prosecutor\u2019s Office overruled that decision on the grounds that it was based on a superficial investigation.", "60.  On 31 December 2011 the investigator once again refused to open a criminal case in relation to K.\u2019s death. Relying on the scene inspection report of 8 November 2011 and the death certificate of 10 November 2011 (see paragraphs 53 and 55 above), he considered that there was no third-party involvement in the death.", "61.  On 16 July 2012 the applicant complained to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office about the ineffectiveness of the investigation. In particular, she submitted that the adequacy and appropriateness of the medical care provided for her son had never been assessed. She noted that there had been no medical monitoring or treatment of K. as regards his HIV. Furthermore, while the HIV diagnosis presupposed a high risk of tuberculosis, K. had not had an X-ray until almost a year after he had tested positive for HIV. The applicant also complained that the intervals between the X-ray sessions had been unreasonably long. Thus, after his X-ray on 6 June 2011 K. had subsequently not had an X-ray until 13 October 2011, whereas a repeat X-ray should have been performed within a two-month time period. Furthermore, although K.\u2019s treatment for tuberculosis had been unsuccessful, it had been continued, and his resistance to the medications prescribed had never been verified. Lastly, the applicant complained that the authorities had not provided her with all the information concerning her son\u2019s health while he had still been alive, despite the numerous inquiries made by her lawyer. In particular, she had only found out about her son\u2019s HIV after his death.", "62.  On 20 July 2012 the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office forwarded the above complaint to the Kyiv Prosecutor\u2019s Office.", "63.  On 15 August 2012 the Svyatoshynskyy Prosecutor\u2019s Office wrote to the applicant saying that her complaint concerning her son\u2019s death and the allegedly inadequate medical care he had received had already been investigated. As a result, it had been decided on 31 December 2011 that there were no grounds for opening a criminal case (see paragraph 60 above).

At the beginning of November 2008 some equipment was stolen from the enterprise at which the applicant worked.", "7.  The Kharkiv Ordzhonikidze District Police Department invited the applicant and one of her colleagues for questioning in respect of the theft.", "8.  On 8 November 2008, at 11.15 a.m., the applicant came to the police station.", "9.  At about 11.35 a.m. on 8 November 2008 a senior detective officer, T., accompanied the applicant to the fourth floor of the police station. He asked her to wait in the corridor and entered office no. 56. Five minutes later the applicant heard a woman\u2019s scream emanating from that office. T. opened the door and directed an officer passing by to take the applicant to his office. She was made to wait there for about twenty minutes. Then T. took her to office no. 56. He pushed her inside, twisted her arms behind her back and handcuffed her, even though she had offered no resistance.", "10.  T. and his colleague, S., who was also in the office, intimidated the applicant with a view to making her confess to the investigated theft. They told her that her colleague, Ms L., had already started to \u201ccrack\u201d. The applicant noticed Ms L.\u2019s belongings on the floor. She concluded that it was her scream that she had heard.", "11.  Having failed to obtain a confession from the applicant, T. and S. made her sit on a chair, put a plastic bag over her head and started to strangle her. At the same time they struck her head, face and mouth so that she could not bite through the bag. The applicant fainted several times. When she told the officers she needed to use the toilet, S. hit her in the stomach and the head. She fainted once again and urinated involuntarily. Sometime later the applicant noticed the presence of another officer, P., in the office.", "12.  After several hours of ill-treatment, the applicant was taken to another office where she stayed for about twenty minutes. Thereafter she was brought before a female officer, who conducted her formal questioning.", "13.  At about 6 p.m. the applicant signed the official report of the questioning. She was then taken to the office of the head of the search unit, who stated that she was the main suspect in the theft case and that all her colleagues had indicated her as the likely thief. The applicant complained about her ill-treatment. Her complaint was ignored.", "14.  She was taken again to office no. 56, where the officers threatened her and tried to pressure her into confessing. She repeatedly refused to do so and professed her innocence. The applicant was forced to write a statement that she had no complaints about the way the police had treated her.", "15.  At about 8 p.m. on 8 November 2008 she was released.", "16.  The applicant submitted to the Court five colour photographs of herself in which extensive bruising on her both arms and forearms is visible.", "17.  On 9 November 2008 (the day following her release) the applicant felt unwell and called an ambulance.", "18.  From 9 to 27 November 2008 she underwent in-patient hospital treatment for a closed head injury, concussion, soft tissue contusions on the head, upper and lower limbs, bruising of the abdominal wall, lumbar osteochondrosis and asthenia.", "19.  On 9 November 2008 the hospital authorities informed the Ordzhonikidze Police Department about the applicant\u2019s injuries allegedly inflicted on her by police officers.", "20.  On 10 November 2008 the applicant complained to the Kharkiv Ordzhonikidze District Prosecutor\u2019s Office (\u201cthe Ordzhonikidze Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u201d) about her ill-treatment. Ms L. lodged a similar complaint.", "21.  On 18 November 2008 the police department refused to open a criminal case following the information from the hospital administration.", "22.  On 12 December 2008 the Ordzhonikidze Prosecutor\u2019s Office opened a criminal case against the police officers on suspicion of their exceeding their powers by engaging in violent and degrading treatment. As a result, on 16 December 2008 the prosecutor also quashed the ruling of 18 November 2008.", "23.  After her discharge from hospital, the applicant remained on sick leave until 19 December 2008.", "24.  On 15 January 2009 the investigator seized the trousers which the applicant had been wearing on 8 November 2008. A forensic immunological examination discovered traces of her urine on them.", "25.  From 27 November 2008 until 26 January 2009 a forensic medical expert evaluation was carried out with a view to establishing the applicant\u2019s injuries and their nature. That evaluation was based on her medical file, as well as a medical examination of her. The expert considered it established that, at the time of her hospitalisation, the applicant had had bruises to both arms that had been inflicted by blunt objects a day to three days previously. The expert stated that it was impossible to establish more precisely the time at which those injuries had been inflicted. As regards the soft tissue contusions, the expert did not find it necessary to take that diagnosis into account as being based merely on a personal opinion of the doctor who had examined the applicant. The same doctor\u2019s diagnoses of a closed head injury and concussion were considered by the expert as not sufficiently supported by \u201cclinical data\u201d. Lastly, the expert report stated that the applicant was suffering from neurotic asthenia, but that it was impossible to establish its origin.", "26.  On 9 February 2009 a forensic expert evaluation was carried out of the applicant\u2019s handwritten statement on the official report on the questioning of 8 November 2008. The expert concluded that she had been \u201cin an unusual state\u201d when writing that note.", "27.  On the same date officer T. challenged the decision of 12 December 2008 before the Ordzhonikidze District Court (\u201cthe Ordzhonikidze Court\u201d).", "28.  On 24 February 2009 the Ordzhonikidze Court rejected his complaint.", "29.  On 19 March 2009, however, the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) quashed that decision and remitted the case to the first-instance court for fresh examination.", "30.  Between 3 March and 2 April 2009 another forensic medical expert evaluation of the applicant\u2019s injuries was carried out. It concluded that she had sustained numerous bruises on her arms, shoulders and thighs. These could have been inflicted at the time and in the circumstances described by her. Because of the delay before the first forensic medical examination was undertaken, it appeared impossible to reach more specific findings.", "31.  On 22 April 2009 the Ordzhonikidze Court quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 12 December 2008. This ruling was quashed by the Court of Appeal on 7 May 2009.", "32.  On 5 June 2009 the Ordzhonikidze Court once again quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 12 December 2008. On 25 June 2009 this ruling too was quashed by the Court of Appeal.", "33.  On 18 November 2009 the applicant and Ms L. identified the officers who had ill-treated them from photographs shown to them by the investigator.", "34.  On 4 February 2010, however, the investigator closed the criminal case against the police officers, citing a lack of proof of their guilt.", "35.  On 30 September 2010 the Ordzhonikidze Court upheld that decision.", "36.  On 15 November 2010 the Court of Appeal quashed the ruling of the first-instance court and remitted the case to it for fresh examination.", "37.

The applicant was born in 1989 and is detained in Opole Lubelskie.", "6.  On 29 June 2007 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody in the Bia\u0142a Podlaska Prison on suspicion of having committed a murder. He had a criminal record and had previously been detained.", "7.  On 17 December 2009 he was convicted of a murder and sentenced to 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant appealed.", "8.  On 10 November 2010 the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed the challenged judgment and remitted the case.", "9.  On 13 May 2014 the Lublin Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to 13 years\u2019 imprisonment.", "10.  On 14 August 2007 the Biala Podlaska Prison Penitentiary Commission classified the applicant as a dangerous detainee. It relied on the applicant\u2019s attempted escape while being transported outside the prison and on the serious nature of the offence he had been charged with.", "11.  On an unspecified day in September 2007, the applicant was transferred to the Lublin Remand Centre. On 3 October 2007 the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission also imposed the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant. Subsequently, the commission extended the application of the dangerous detainee regime to the applicant on numerous occasions. The applicant submitted copies of the decisions of the commission dated: 6 May 2008, 19 March 2009, 12 August and 23 December 2010, 23 March, 23 June and 14 July 2011 and 15 March 2012. All these decisions were issued on a special form containing space for reasoning. However, these forms only refer to the applicant\u2019s progress in rehabilitation, classifying it as \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d.", "12.  On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to the Kielce Remand Centre.", "13.  On 30 March 2010 the Kielce Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission also imposed the dangerous detainee regime on the applicant. The applicant appealed.", "14.  On 28 June 2010 the Kielce Regional Court upheld the decision. It first noted that it was capable of examining whether the commission had remained within the limits of reasonableness and the limits of free assessment of circumstances of the case. It further held that the decision had been issued in accordance with the law and that it had been justified taking into account the applicant\u2019s aggressive and vulgar behaviour in the remand centre, his refusing meals and his unrepentent attitude towards the offences of which he had been convicted by the first-instance court. The court also found that the applicant had received disciplinary penalties on 22 occasions for establishing illegal contacts.", "15.  On an unspecified date in 2010 the applicant was transferred back to the Lublin Remand Centre.", "16.  On 31 August 2010 he complained about the conditions of his detention and the further extension of his classification as a dangerous detainee to the regional inspector of the Prison Service.", "17.  On 2 November 2010 the inspector, relying on the applicant\u2019s attempted escape while being transported, found the complaint ill-founded. He also referred to the applicant\u2019s self-mutilation on 17 June 2010 and found that on 18 June 2010 he had been examined by a psychologist who had not found any obstacles to placing the applicant in solitary confinement as a disciplinary penalty.", "18.  The applicant appealed against the decisions of 23 December 2010 and 23 March 2011. In his appeal against the former decision the applicant claimed, in particular, that the commission had arbitrarily classified him as \u201cdangerous\u201d, that he had no access to the opinions and the prison authorities\u2019 request leading to this classification, and he had been debased and humiliated by \u201c[being] consciously kept ... in inhuman conditions\u201d.", "19.  On 28 February 2011 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the appeal, finding that the applicant\u2019s classification had been justified in view of the fact that on 14 August 2007 he had unlawfully tried to escape while being transported. The court further referred to the fact that the applicant had been charged with murder and held that this alone would be sufficient to justify the dangerous detainee classification even without the attempted escape.\nThe court further held:\n\u201cFurther circumstances such as personal conditions, the applicant\u2019s behaviour in detention and the extent of his lack of moral character are subject to assessment and the decision in this respect cannot be examined from the viewpoint of lawfulness. It could be examined as regards its equity; this however would go beyond the limits of examination laid down by Article 7 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences.\u201d\nAs regards the applicant\u2019s further complaints the court held that they did not have any influence on the commission\u2019s decision and as such \u201cdid not even merit examination.\u201d", "20.  On 11 May 2011 the Lublin Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 23 March 2011 holding that it had been based on \u201cthe applicant\u2019s attitude and negative behaviour and the assessment of his rehabilitation progress\u201d.", "21.  On 22 September 2011 the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission lifted the dangerous detainee regime imposed on the applicant. It relied on the applicant\u2019s good behaviour.", "22.  In total, the dangerous detainee regime was applied to the applicant for four years, one month and nine days.", "23.  The applicant was detained in several detention facilities, specifically Bia\u0142a Podlaska Prison and in Lublin, Mokot\u00f3w, Bia\u0142ystok and Kielce Remand Centres.", "24.  In the Kielce Remand Centre the cells were constantly monitored via closed-circuit television. According to the Government, the applicant could publish articles in the prison bulletin and participate in competitions. He had access to a library and cultural and educational activities.", "25.  In the Mokot\u00f3w and Bia\u0142ystok Remand Centres the cells and other areas in which the applicant was allowed were under special surveillance. The applicant was subject to a strip search each time he entered and left his cell. He was supervised by two officers each time he was outside of his cell. He had access to a library and daily newspapers, and could listen to the radio. He also had access to a recreation room with sport facilities. Additionally, in the Bia\u0142ystok Remand Centre he could participate in the programme of reintegration into society.", "26.  The applicant spent most of the time complained of in the Lublin Remand Centre. The cell there was equipped with a sanitary facility which was not separated from the rest of the cell. The cell, including its sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via closed-circuit television.", "27.  The applicant had to wear a red uniform designated for dangerous detainees, which was not warm enough in winter. He was subjected to a strip search every time he left and entered the cell, which in practice meant that he had to strip naked in front of prison officers and was required to bend over in order to enable the examination of his anus. According to the applicant, whenever he was outside his cell, including his appearances at court hearings, he had to wear joined shackles (kajdanki zespolone) on his hands and feet. Those shackles consisted of handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains. According to the Government\u2019s submissions the applicant had to wear the joined shackles only when being transported. In prison, when outside his cell, he wore handcuffs.", "28.  The applicant had a one-hour-long period of outdoor exercise per day.", "29.  The cell window was covered with a plastic blind which, according to the applicant, limited access to fresh air and natural light in the cell. The cell was constantly in semi-darkness and for reading, even during the day, the applicant needed to use artificial light.", "30.  The applicant could participate in cultural activities and use the library three times a week; he also had access to a recreation room, equipped with a television, games, a laptop and work-out facilities.", "31.  Some disciplinary measures had to be applied to the applicant because of his aggressive and vulgar attitude toward prison guards.

On 24 May 1961 the applicant\u2019s husband was granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of a flat in Zagreb by the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army (the \u201cYPA\u201d). The applicant, as his spouse, was also a holder of a specially protected tenancy of that flat.", "7.  On 3 June 1991 Parliament enacted the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Sale to Occupier Act\u201d), which regulated the sale of socially-owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy (see paragraph 19 below). However, State-owned flats were excluded.", "8. On 3 October 1991 the Government adopted a decree (Uredba o preuzimanju sredstava JNA i SSNO na teritoriju Republike Hrvatske u vlasni\u0161tvo Republike Hrvatske) whereby it took all the YPA\u2019s property in Croatia into State ownership.", "9.  In 1995 the Act Amending the Sale to Occupier Act (Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Zakona o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe APTSO\u201d) allowed the sale of State-owned flats as well (see paragraph 22 below). The time-limit for lodging a request to purchase such a flat was set at sixty days.", "10.  On 29 January 1997 the Constitutional Court abrogated some of the provisions of the APTSO, including the one stipulating the time-limit for lodging a purchase request (see paragraph 23 below)", "11.  The applicant\u2019s husband died on 15 April 2006.", "12.  On 7 June 2006 the applicant lodged with the Ministry of Defence a request to purchase the flat she was occupying. The request was denied on the ground that it had been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit, which had expired on 31 December 1995.", "13.  On 19 March 2008 the applicant brought a civil action in the Zagreb Municipal Court seeking a judgment in lieu of a sale contract. She relied on several decisions of the Constitutional Court ruling that there was no time-limit in respect of a holder of a specially protected tenancy lodging a request to purchase the respective State-owned flat (see paragraphs 24-26 below).", "14.  In its judgment of 24 June 2008 the Zagreb Municipal Court held that there was no dispute between the parties that the applicant, as a former holder of a specially protected tenancy of the flat that she occupied, had the right to purchase that flat under favourable conditions. The only issue to be resolved was whether there was a time-limit that the applicant had to observe when lodging her request to purchase that flat \u2013 and if so, whether she had complied with it. The Municipal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim on the ground that the applicant had lodged her purchase request outside the accepted time-limit, which had been 31 December 1995.", "15.  The applicant lodged an appeal, arguing that the time-limit under the APTSO for lodging a request to purchase a State-owned flat had been abrogated by the Constitutional Court and that no new time-limit had been fixed. The fact that there was no prescribed time-limit in place should not have been interpreted to the detriment of a plaintiff. She also relied on the opinion of the Constitutional Court that the very purpose of the Sale to Occupier Act was to enable holders of specially protected tenancies in respect of socially and State-owned flats to purchase such flats (see paragraph 22 below).", "16.  The first-instance judgment was upheld by the Zagreb County Court on 12 October 2010. The relevant part of the second-instance judgment reads:\n\u201cAs regards the decisions of the Constitutional Court relied on in the [plaintiff\u2019s] action, it is to be noted that these decisions exceptionally recognised the right of certain parties to purchase flats [they occupied] in particular circumstances (such as their having had no clearly regulated status of holder of a specially protected tenancy before that date \u2013 for example in decision no. U-3551/02 of 25 May 2005) ... even though a request to purchase a flat had not been lodged before 31 December 1995. In such particular cases the Constitutional Court has adopted decisions based on particular circumstances. The Constitutional Court in all decisions recognising the right to purchase flats [they occupied] of persons who had not lodged a request in that respect before 31 December 1995 has accepted that there were objective circumstances preventing those persons from taking all relevant steps within the prescribed time-limits. In the case at issue the plaintiff did not even argue [that there were any] such circumstances, but insisted that she could bring an action for the purchase of the flat [that she occupies] at any time and that there were no time-limits in that respect.\nThe view of this court is that the holders of specially protected tenancies of State-owned flats were obliged to lodge a request for purchasing these flats before 31 December 1995 (with the exception that in certain circumstances it was possible to claim that a party was prevented from lodging such a request within that time-limit on objective grounds).\u201d", "17.  The applicant\u2019s subsequent constitutional complaint was dismissed on 20 February 2013. The relevant part of that decision reads:\n\u201cThe Constitutional Court notes that the competent courts dismissed the applicant\u2019s civil action on the grounds that she had not proved that any objective circumstances had prevented her from lodging a request to purchase the flat in issue within the prescribed time-limit.

The first applicant organisation is the Vienna Chamber of Medical Doctors (\u00c4rztekammer f\u00fcr Wien). The Chamber represents all medical practitioners in Vienna and also has its own website. The second applicant was the Chamber\u2019s president at the time of the events.", "6.  On 18 January 2007 the second applicant published a letter on the first applicant organisation\u2019s website, which was addressed to all members of the Chamber in Vienna and was also sent out to all of them via e-mail. The letter was titled \u201cLocust funds want to take over medical practices\u201d (\u201cHeuschreckenfonds wollen Ordinationen \u00fcbernehmen\u201d). The second applicant went on to state that he had been forced to write to his colleagues for a serious reason, namely, because it had been reported in the media that the F. company planned to go into \u201cthe radiology business\u201d. He added that share-bidding companies planned to offer medical services \u2013 initially in the area of radiology, but soon enough in other areas of the profession as well \u2011 and that doctors risked becoming mere employees of such \u201clocust\u201d companies. If they would not act according to the companies\u2019 wishes, they would be dismissed. The second applicant then explained the assumed legal and organisational basis of such a plan: radiology services which were currently being provided by medical practices could, in future, also be offered by limited companies. Shares of those companies could then be bought by the F. company, and the \u201clocusts\u201d would reach their goal, namely control of the medical profession. Giving an example of a risky development, the second applicant stated that in the last 20 years, colleagues had founded laboratories which had reciprocal agreements with certain health insurance boards. Today, almost all of those laboratories were owned by the F. group, which, in turn, was owned by insurance companies, investment funds and foundations, and which employed a large number of doctors. The second applicant ended his letter by stating that he could guarantee one thing: that the doctors\u2019 professional representative body would make use of all legal and political means available to stop such a disastrous development from going ahead, to prevent that the quality of medical treatment being determined by \u201cmanagers and controllers\u201d and to ensure, inter alia, that existing medical practices were protected from the competition from \u201cinternational locust funds\u201d (\u201cinternationale Heuschreckenfonds\u201d).", "7.  On 24 January 2007 the F. company lodged an action against the two applicants and an application for an injunction with the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht Wien). The applicants contested the application.", "8.  On 16 February 2007 the Vienna Commercial Court issued an injunction prohibiting the applicants (each of them individually) from repeating the statement that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties, in particular medical professionals. The injunction prevented the applicants from referring to the F. company as a \u201clocust\u201d, \u201clocust company\u201d or \u201clocust fund\u201d. The applicants were further prohibited from stating that the provision of services by the F. company, particularly services in the area of radiology, was a disastrous development. The court found that there was a competitive relationship between the F. company and the applicants, and found the statements made by the applicants to be defamatory under Article 1330 of the Civil Code and unethical under the Unfair Competition Act (Bundesgesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb).", "9.  The applicants appealed against the injunction. On 30 October 2007 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Wien) partly granted the appeal, and prohibited the applicants from alleging that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties and medical practitioners, and from calling it, inter alia, a \u201clocust company\u201d. However, it dismissed the F. company\u2019s application to prohibit the applicants from calling its provision of services a \u201cdisastrous\u201d development. The Court of Appeal found that the first applicant organisation had locus standi in the injunction proceedings. The Chamber of Medical Doctors held official authority status in relation to certain areas of its work (Bereich der Hoheitsverwaltung), in addition to representing the interests of its members; it was therefore considered a legal entity under the Official Liability Act (Amtshaftungsgesetz). However, when acting as a special interest group, it represented its members\u2019 interests from a mainly economic perspective, rather than acting in its capacity as an official authority. According to the Court of Appeal, the letter in issue pursued the interests of the Chamber\u2019s members, outside the Chamber\u2019s official sphere of activity.", "10.  The Court of Appeal further established, referring inter alia to Wikipedia, that the term \u201clocust company\u201c (\u201cHeuschreckenunternehmen\u201c) was introduced into the political discussion in German speaking countries in 2005 by Mr Franz M\u00fcntefering, a German politician, and is ever since used in political debates as a pejorative term for private-equity companies or other forms of capital funds with short-term or exaggerated return expectations \u2013 like hedge funds or \u201evulture\u201c funds, which also had negative connotations. The domestic court found that there was a need to balance the interests involved in the present debate, reiterating that extreme opinions were only unlawful if they were excessive. As a result of that balancing exercise, the Court of Appeal found that the \u201clocust\u201d statement had to be considered a lawful criticism in the context of a public debate, and that the F. company could therefore not base its claim on Article 1330 of the Civil Code. However, the Court of Appeal classified the applicants\u2019 actions as competitive in nature. Statements of fact made in violation of the Unfair Competition Act could not be justified by the right to freedom of expression. The Court of Appeal found that Austrian law provided wide\u2011ranging protection for commercial and economic interests. Those who published an opinion in an economically competitive context were obliged to exercise a higher level of diligence with regard to the facts and bases of their allegations than those who acted in the non-competitive context of a public debate of general interest. Therefore, the Court of Appeal upheld the injunction decision with regard to the statements about the \u201clocust company\u201d.", "11.  However, as regards the further statement, namely that provision of certain services by the F. company was a \u201cdisastrous development\u201d, the Court of Appeal found that, read in context, the statement indicated a general assessment and did not refer to a particular service of the F. company. It was therefore to be considered a personal opinion, and thus a value judgment that was not defamatory under Article 1330 of the Civil Code. It also did not fall under section 7 of the Unfair Competition Act.", "12.  The applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof). On 22 January 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the extraordinary appeal. It acknowledged the applicants\u2019 argument that where a competitor, even for economic purposes, took part in a debate of public interest, freedom of expression had to hold more weight in the balancing test. However, the Supreme Court observed that the applicants had made their statement in the clearly economic context of competition between medical practitioners and companies which provided the same services. The applicants could have warned their members of the possible risks of cooperating with companies without overstepping the margin of acceptable criticism. However, the applicants had exceeded that limit and stated that the F. company was a \u201clocust\u201d. That statement was one of fact, and the applicants had not provided evidence of a factual basis for their allegations, and had therefore exceeded the permissible limitations of freedom of expression.", "13.  On 7 July 2008 the Commercial Court gave its judgment in the substantive proceedings and ordered the applicants to refrain from: repeating the statement that the F. company was ruthless towards third parties, in particular medical practitioners and patients; and stating that the F. company was a \u201clocust company\u201d, a \u201clocust fund\u201d or a \u201clocust\u201d. It further ordered the applicants to publish and display the operative part of the judgment on the first applicant organisation\u2019s website for thirty days, and to publish it in the first applicant organisation\u2019s print newsletter.", "14.  The Commercial Court made substantial reference to the Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in the interim injunction proceedings. It followed the previous finding that the relevant statements did not constitute defamation pursuant to Article 1330 of the Civil Code. Examining the statements in relation to the provisions of the Unfair Competition Act, the Commercial Court found that the letter had been written by the Chamber of Medical Doctors in a commercial and not a political context. It had also had the advancement of independent medical practices as an objective, and had contained a warning regarding capital ventures which allegedly threatened doctors\u2019 independence. The Commercial Court found the relevant comparisons with \u201clocusts\u201d to be statements of fact regarding both the F. company and its conduct in relation to third parties, doctors and patients. The statements were also likely to damage the F. company\u2019s commercial interests, and had not been proved to be true.", "15.  The used language could also not be justified with a reference to the right to freedom of expression as the statement was uttered within the framework of a commercial competitive relationship. With reference to the Court\u2019s case-law allowing for a wider margin of appreciation under Article 10 of the Convention with regard to commercial language, the Commercial Court observed that a competitor was required to be more diligent in the context of commercial communication among competitors. The term \u201clocust\u201d was almost exclusively loaded with negative meaning, which led to the unethical general vilification of a competitor. The applicants were therefore prohibited from using that statement in relation to the F. company, pursuant to the Unfair Competition Act.", "16.  On 19 September 2008 the applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment. On 12 December 2008 the Vienna Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as unfounded. It referred to the extensive reasoning given in the interim injunction proceedings and added that, according to the case-law of the Supreme Court, the test used to verify whether a statement was covered by the right to freedom of expression required the assessment of whether a factual basis for such a statement existed; if a competitor participated in a public debate of general interest, freedom of expression had more weight with regard to the assessment of the statement than in the context of purely commercial communication. The greater the public interest in being properly informed and the less the statement related to commercial interests, the more the statement would be protected by Article 10 of the Convention. In the present case, there was no doubt that there was an ongoing public debate; however, the commercial interests of the applicants had very much been in the foreground of the communicated statement itself.", "17.  The applicants lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law against that judgment, which was rejected by the Supreme Court on 14 July 2009. The Supreme Court found that the applicants had not only called the F. company a \u201clocust\u201d, but had also reproached this company for negative conduct, such as dominating doctors, dismissing doctors who did not act in accordance with company wishes, and focusing on economic factors rather than the welfare of patients (\u201cHerrschaft \u00fcber den \u00e4rztlichen Berufstand, K\u00fcndigung nicht \u201cspurender\u201d \u00c4rzte, Orientierung an \u00f6konomischen Erw\u00e4gungen und damit nicht am Wohl der Patienten\u201d). Therefore, the expression used had turned into a statement of fact, giving the reader the impression that the F. company had already demonstrated unethical conduct which threatened the interests of doctors and patients. In view of the specific circumstances of the case, the prohibition ruled upon by the lower courts was justified. Even though the applicants had taken part in a debate of general public interest, an untrue and damaging statement of fact was not protected by freedom of expression. Furthermore, the issuing of warnings concerning the potential risks of the provision of medical services by companies was not, as such, prohibited by the decisions of the Austrian courts; the applicants had only been required to refrain from making untrue statements of fact in respect of their competitors.", "18.

The circumstances of the case are disputed by the parties.\nThe killing of Mr Apti Dalakov and subsequent events", "7.  At about 5 p.m. on 2 September 2007 Mr Apti Dalakov and his friend Mr I.D. left a computer club in Karabulak. While they were walking down Oskanova Street, two Gazel minivans with heavily tinted windows and without number plates pulled over and a group of men armed with assault rifles and pistols emerged from the vehicles. Two of the armed men wore plain clothes, while the others were in camouflage uniforms and balaclavas. Without identifying themselves or giving any explanation they pointed their guns at Mr Apti Dalakov and Mr I.D. and opened fire. Mr Apti Dalakov ran away. The armed men pursued him and continued shooting.", "8.  In Dzhabagiyeva Street, in the presence of a number of local residents, including Mr I.B.M., Ms A.I.Ts. and Ms F.Kh.Ts., Mr Apti Dalakov was hit by a car and fell to the ground. He got up and limped into the courtyard of the adjacent nursery school. A man from the car which had hit Mr Apti Dalakov ran after him and fired at him several times with his pistol. Mr Apti Dalakov fell to the ground face down. Several other armed men ran towards the scene and one of them fired at Mr Apti Dalakov several times while he was on the ground. After having ascertained that Mr Apti Dalakov was dead, one of the armed men lifted his body and placed an object under it.", "9.  Shortly thereafter a group of officers of the local police and the special police force (\u041e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f (\u041e\u041c\u041e\u041d)) (hereinafter \u201cthe OMON\u201d) arrived at the scene. A number of civilians present on the premises and the adjacent streets alerted the police officers to the fact that Mr Apti Dalakov had not offered any resistance to his pursuers, that he had not been armed and that his pursuers had placed an object under his body; it turned out to be a hand grenade with its pin pulled. The police officers requested the pursuers, who were officers of the Ingushetia Department of the Federal Security Service (\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 (\u0424\u0421\u0411)) (hereinafter \u201cthe FSB\u201d) to identify themselves; they refused to do so. In the ensuing scuffle the police officers arrested the FSB officers and took them to the Karabulak town police department. Mr I.D., who had been arrested by FSB officers after the chase, was also arrested by the town police and then released several days later.", "10.  After bomb disposal experts had deactivated the grenade, Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s body was taken for a post-mortem examination and was returned to his relatives for burial at midnight on 2 September 2007.", "11.  The above account of the events is based on the information contained in the application form as well as on written statements by Mr I.B.M., dated 26 September 2007, Ms A.I.Ts. and Ms F.Kh.Ts., both dated 2 October 2007, and a written statement by the applicant dated 31 July 2009.\n(b)  The Government\u2019s submission", "12.  Referring to the contents of the investigation file in criminal case no. 27520028 the Government stated in their submission of 22 January 2014 that the circumstances of the incident had been as follows.\n\u201c6.  Between 5.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. on 2 September 2007 servicemen of the Ingushetia FSB found presumed members of a bandit group Mr Apti Dalakov and Mr [I.D.] The FSB servicemen got out of the service car and attempted to detain these two men. They ordered the two men to get down on the ground, having identified themselves as FSB agents. 7.  Mr [I.D.] obeyed and lay down on the ground. Mr Apti Dalakov did not comply with the order and started to run away. One of the FSB agents followed him. During the pursuit he warned Mr Apti Dalakov that he would open fire if the latter did not stop. ... Mr Apti Dalakov stopped, took a grenade from his pocket and prepared to pull the pin. Taking into account information in their possession concerning the presumed criminal activity of Mr Apti Dalakov and his refusal to obey law-enforcement agents\u2019 orders, the FSB officer took the decision to open fire, shooting to kill in order to eliminate the threat to his own life and health and that of the other people present at the time in the street.\n... 9.  As regards Mr [I.D.], on 3 September 2007 the record of his arrest was drawn up and he was questioned as a suspect ... arrest as a measure of restraint was chosen for him. He was released ten days later, and on or about 23 September 2007 he left to live permanently in Kazakhstan ...\u201d", "13.  On 2 September 2007 the Karabulak investigating department of the Investigating Committee with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office of the Russian Federation in Ingushetia (hereinafter \u201cthe investigating department\u201d) opened criminal case no. 27520028 against Mr Apti Dalakov under Articles 317 and 222 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (assault on a law-enforcement official and unlawful possession of arms and explosives).", "14.  On the same date, 2 September 2007, the investigating department examined the crime scene. According to the crime scene report, forty cartridge cases were collected from the scene and a grenade was found under Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s body, under the lower part of his stomach. No objects were found in the hands of Mr Apti Dalakov. As a result, forty cartridges and the grenade were collected from the scene for expert examination.", "15.  Between 2 and 11 September 2007 a senior operational search officer, Mr A.Kh. of the Internal Investigations Department of the Ingushetia Ministry of the Interior, conducted an internal inquiry in connection with \u201ccollaboration between police officers from the Ingushetia Ministry of the Interior and officers of the Ingushetia Federal Security Service\u201d concerning the circumstances of Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing. Its results were stated in conclusion no. 172 dated 11 September 2007. The document, amongst other things, contained the following information:\n\u201c... at about 5 p.m. on 2 September 2007 the FSB officers conducted a special operation in Karabulak aimed at arresting members of illegal armed groups.\nThe local police department was not informed about it.\nDuring the special operation, the FSB officers eliminated a member of an illegal armed group, Mr Apti Dalakov, who had offered active armed resistance.\nAt about 5.20 p.m. police captain [G.G.], who was on duty, ... had seen two armed men pursuing a young man who was running away; one of the armed men had opened fire on him. The pursuers had been accompanied by a white Gazel vehicle with darkened windows and without number plates.\nCaptain [G.G.] had reported the incident to the duty unit of the Karabulak town police department, and had remained at his post ...\nA group of police officers dispatched to the crime scene from the town police station and a group of Ingushetia OMON which had arrived there after hearing shots from automatic weapons ... found a dead man and a disorderly group of about 100 people, some in camouflage uniforms and others in civilian clothing, who were shouting ... and yelling about why the police were not arresting armed bandits who had killed an unarmed man who had not offered any resistance.\nThe armed men, who were in camouflage uniforms and civilian clothing, who had conducted this special operation, had refused to identify themselves, had not presented any documents, and had warned that they would use firearms against the police officers.\nThe law-enforcement officers of Karabulak had taken those men for terrorists and/or active members of illegal armed groups ...\nUnder these circumstances, to prevent the presumed law-enforcement officers from being lynched by the enraged crowd, the head of the Karabulak town police department, Lieutenant-Colonel [A.M.], had tried to separate the armed men who had killed [the man on the ground] and the civilians from the local residents. However, the police officers had ended up being isolated by the unidentified armed men and had become, in effect, their hostages; the armed men had behaved aggressively and refused to state what organisation they belonged to.\nThe OMON group had arrived at the scene, quickly assessed the situation, and then blocked and disarmed the unidentified individuals using special physical force techniques against those who resisted. After that the armed men were taken to the Karabulak town police department and the premises of the OMON unit (the entire perimeter of the town police station had been surrounded by civilians expressing their indignation at the actions of the unidentified persons who had made several \u201cinsurance\u201d shots to the head of the unarmed wounded young man who had fallen to the ground next to the nursery school and who, according to the nearby residents, then had placed an armed grenade under his body to make it look like the young man had offered resistance).\nThe Ingushetia Minister of the Interior and the head of the Ingushetia FSB had arrived at the scene and taken the decision to immediately release the arrested persons to avoid making their identities known to the public ...\nThe unidentified persons ... had offered resistance to the OMON officers ... as a result [of the scuffle], the police officers [M.O.] and [M.K.] and the head of the operational search unit of the Karabulak town police department, Lieutenant\u2011Colonel [A.Ts.], required medical assistance...\nAll the arrested persons who were law-enforcement officers were released without logging their names in the detention log upon confirmation of their identities by the head of the Ingushetia FSB; their guns were returned to them ...\nTherefore, the above misunderstanding took place due to lack of proper coordination between the law-enforcement agencies who were carrying out a special task in the Republic of Ingushetia ...\u201d", "16.  The documents submitted indicate that on various dates in September 2007 the investigators questioned several witnesses who lived near the crime scene. For the most part the witnesses stated that they had not seen the actual events but had seen a young\u2019s man body on the ground surrounded by a large number of police who had cordoned off the area.", "17.  On 12 September 2007 the investigators questioned Ms F.Kh.Ts., who stated that at about 5 p.m. on 2 September 2007 she had been at home. She had looked out of the window on to Dzhabagiyeva Street and heard a muffled sound of an impact. Then she had seen a young man limping rapidly past her window into the premises of the nursery school. He had been followed by a masked man in camouflage uniform with a pistol and a man with a camouflage T\u2011shirt pulled over his head. This man was running with an automatic rifle and firing at the young man. Then all three men went round the corner of the building. The witness had immediately run outside and followed the men. She saw the young man on his stomach on the ground, convulsing. The other two men were standing next to him and arguing. Then one of them ordered the witness to go away and she obeyed the order. After that a large number of police officers had arrived at the scene and cordoned off the area.", "18.  On 12 September 2007 the Ingushetia Forensic Examinations Bureau (\u201cthe Forensic Bureau\u201d) concluded that the detonating fuse of the grenade recovered from the crime scene was not capable of exploding due to a missing part, but that the grenade itself was capable of exploding provided the fuse was in working condition.", "19.  On 19 September 2007 the investigators questioned a police officer of the Ingushetia OMON, Akh.Ya., who stated that at about 5.30 p.m. on 2 September 2007 he had been at work when he and his colleagues had heard sounds of sporadic gunfire coming from the area around Karabulak central market. He and thirteen to fifteen of his colleagues were then dispatched to the scene of the shooting, next to the nursery school. Upon arrival at the scene the witnesses had seen a large crowd of local residents and a group of about twelve to fifteen masked men with automatic firearms. The local residents had been aggressively expressing their indignation, as according to them the armed men had killed an unarmed young man; the body was still on the ground. The armed men had refused to identify themselves or to give reasons for killing the young man. They resisted the police officers: behaved aggressively, swore, fired their weapons into the air several times, and threatened the police with firearms. When the second group of police arrived, owing to the armed men\u2019s behaviour and the threats from the outraged crowd of local residents they disarmed the masked men, forced them into a Ural lorry, and took them to the Karabulak town police department.", "20.  Between 20 and 28 September 2007 the investigators questioned the police officers M.K., M.Ku., B.She., M.Ts. and A.-G.M.; their statements concerning the events were similar to that of their colleague Akh.Ya.", "21.  On 22 September 2007 the investigators were informed by the Ingushetia FSB that it was impossible to question their officers implicated in the incident, as they were all undergoing medical treatment in hospital in Kislovodsk, Russia.", "22.  On 26 September 2007 the investigators questioned police officer Captain G.G., who stated that at about 5.30 p.m. on 2 September 2007 he had been on duty across the road from the nursery school. He had heard the gunshots and immediately called the police station. After that he had run out into the street and seen two men in the sand-coloured camouflage uniforms of special service agents. The men, who had been running ahead, had been firing at someone in front of them. Then the two men went round the corner of a building and out of sight. Then the men following them in a white Gazel minivan without registration numbers had turned and driven off.", "23.  On 1 October 2007 the Forensic Bureau informed the investigators of its conclusions concerning the cause of Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s death. According to their report of 3 September 2007, Mr Apti Dalakov had died from gunshot wounds, including two in the back, one in the back of the lower leg, and one in the back of the head.", "24.  On 15 or 16 October 2007 the investigators questioned an FSB officer, V.L., and granted him victim status in the criminal case. In his statement the officer submitted that at about 5 p.m. on 2 September 2007 he and his colleagues had arrived in Karabulak in a service vehicle to identify and detain members of an illegal armed group, Mr I.D. and Mr Apti Dalakov. At about 5.30 p.m. they had received information that both men were heading in their direction. The officers had been given descriptions of Mr I.D. and Mr Apti Dalakov and ordered to detain them. The witness and his colleagues got out of the car, shouted \u201con the ground! FSB!\u201d and ran after the two men. Mr I.D. immediately got down on the ground, whereas Mr Apti Dalakov ran away. The witness thought Mr Apti Dalakov was armed and could offer resistance. The witness and his colleagues put Mr I.D. into their vehicle and then went after Mr Apti Dalakov. When the witness reached Dzhabagiyeva Street he heard \u201cFSB! Stop!\u201d and then \u201cStop or I\u2019ll fire!\u201d and then heard machine-gun shots and ran towards them. He saw his colleagues next to a two-storey building in Dzhabagiyeva Street, standing next to the body of Mr Apti Dalakov and one of the colleagues holding a grenade. He checked Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s pulse and confirmed that he was dead, then the witness and his colleagues called the mine squad and cordoned off the area.", "25.  On 16 and 17 October 2007 the investigators questioned FSB officers A.Ch., I.K., and P.Ch., and granted them victim status in the criminal case. The statements given by the three officers to the investigation were identical to that of their colleague, officer V.L.", "26.  On 2 November 2007 the investigating department terminated the proceedings in case no. 27520028. The decision referred to statements by FSB officers V.L., I.K. and P.Ch. They submitted, among other things, that on 2 September 2007 they had gone to Karabulak to arrest members of an illegal armed group, Mr Apti Dalakov and Mr I.D. When the officers had spotted the two men, they got out of their Gazel minivan and shouted: \u201cFSB! Get down!\u201d. Mr I.D. had complied with the order but Mr Apti Dalakov had run away. Officers A.B. and A.Ch. followed Mr Apti Dalakov, while V.L., I.K. and P.Ch. put Mr I.D. securely into their vehicle. After that they heard shooting and went to Dzhabagiyeva Street, where they found FSB officers and Mr Apti Dalakov, face down on the ground with a grenade in his hand. The officers checked his pulse, ascertained that he was dead, called bomb disposal experts and secured the area. The decision further stated that officers A.B. and P.Ch. \u201chad given similar statements\u201d, without providing any further details in that respect. The examination of the grenade seized at the scene by the authorities had established that it was capable of exploding. The decision concluded that there existed sufficient evidence to prove that Mr Apti Dalakov was guilty of assaulting law\u2011enforcement officials and of unlawful possession of ammunition, but in view of his death in the exchange of fire the criminal case against him was to be terminated. The applicant learnt of that decision at some point in February or March 2008 (see paragraph 40 below).", "27.  On 3 December 2007 the head of the investigating department overruled the decision of 2 November 2007 to terminate the criminal investigation as unsubstantiated at the request of the Karabulak town prosecutor. The latter stated in his request, among other things, the following:\n\u201c... the decision of 2 November 2007 ... is premature, unlawful and unsubstantiated due to the incompleteness of the investigation ... for instance,\nMr [I.D.], who had complied with the order of the arresting group ... was not questioned about the circumstances of the incident.\nIn addition, the investigators did not examine the legal grounds for the use of firearms against Mr A. Dalakov.\nFrom conclusion no. 172 of the internal inquiry of 11 September 2007 carried out by the Internal Investigations Department of the Ingushetia Ministry of the Interior, residents of the nearby houses had stated that after the liquidation of Mr A. Dalakov, an armed grenade had been placed under his body to make it look like he had offered armed resistance. However, this information was not examined further ...\u201d\nThe applicant was informed of the decision on 6 December 2007.", "28.  On 27 December 2007 the investigators separated the part of the evidence concerning the use of the firearms during the incident from criminal case no. 27520028 and forwarded it to another investigator in the Karabulak investigating department for further examination. In the documents submitted it is also stated that on the same date the same material was forwarded to the military investigations department of military unit no. 68799 for examination.", "29.  On 3 January 2008 the investigating department again terminated the proceedings in case no. 27520028 because of the death of the suspect. The text of the decision reiterated in identical wording the decision of 2 November 2007 (see paragraph 26 above).", "30.  On 22 January 2008 the head of the Ingushetia investigating department overruled the decision of 3 January 2008 to terminate the criminal investigation as premature and unsubstantiated. In particular, he pointed out that the investigators had neither questioned Mr I.D. and the FSB officer who had shot Mr Apti Dalakov nor obtained information on the inquiry concerning the use of the firearms against Mr Apti Dalakov by the FSB servicemen.", "31.  On 6 February 2008 the investigation in criminal case no. 27520028 was again terminated, because of the death of the suspect. The text of the decision reiterated verbatim that of 2 November 2007 (see paragraph 26 above) but did not mention that according to the mother of Mr I.D. the latter had moved to Kazakhstan on or about 23 September 2007. The applicant was not informed of that decision.", "32.  On 26 February 2008 the investigators requested the head of the military investigations department to inform them of the results of the examination of the materials concerning Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing.", "33.  On 28 February 2008 the military investigations department replied to the investigators that on 30 January 2008 they had refused to initiate criminal investigation into the killing owing to the lack of corpus delicti in the actions of the FSB officer A.K. who had opened fire on Mr Apti Dalakov. The copy of the decision enclosed with the letter indicated that the decision had been taken on the basis of the explanation given by officer A.K., which was identical to the statement given by him on 5 March 2008 to the investigators in criminal case no. 27520028 (see the paragraph below). Neither the applicant nor his relatives were informed of that decision.", "34.  On 28 February and 5 March 2008 respectively the investigators granted FSB officer A.K. victim status in criminal case no. 27520028 and questioned him. The officer stated that on 2 September 2007, as a member of a special combat group, upon the order of the head of the Ingushetia FSB, he had arrived in Karabulak to carry out a special operation aimed at arresting active members of \u201cthe Karabulak illegal armed group\u201d Mr Apti Dalakov and Mr I.D., who were suspected of involvement in terrorist acts in Ingushetia. Having arrived at the place of the operation next to the nursery school, the officer had got out of the vehicle, run towards Mr I.D. and Mr Apti Dalakov, and shouted: \u201cOn the ground! FSB!\u201d In reply to this warning Mr I.D. had got down on the ground, whereas Mr Apti Dalakov had started running away. The officer had run after him and continued shouting from time to time: \u201cStop! FSB!\u201d Having understood that Mr Apti Dalakov had no intention of stopping, the officer shouted: \u201cFSB! Stop or I\u2019ll fire!\u201d and then fired once into the air when Mr Apti Dalakov was about ten to fifteen metres away from him. At that point Mr Apti Dalakov had stopped, turned round to face the officer, taken a grenade out of the right pocket of his trousers and tried to pull out the fuse. Having assessed the situation as threatening, the officer opened fire, aiming to hit Mr Apti Dalakov. When the shots were fired Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s body was flung about in various directions and then he fell to the ground face down. After ascertaining that Mr Apti Dalakov was dead, the officer reported the incident to the head of the operation. The latter ordered the officer and his colleagues from the FSB to cordon off the area and wait for the investigators\u2019 arrival.", "35.  On 5 September 2007 a relative of Mr Apti Dalakov, Mr M.Kh., complained to the Karabulak town prosecutor about the killing of Mr Apti Dalakov and asked for a criminal investigation to be opened into the matter.", "36.  On 20 and 29 September 2007 the applicant complained about the killing to the Ingushetia Prosecutor and the Karabulak town prosecutor.", "37.  On 10 October 2007 the town prosecutor replied to the applicant that on 2 September 2007 criminal case no. 27520028 had been opened against Mr Apti Dalakov concerning assault on a law-enforcement official and unlawful possession of arms and explosives. The letter did not specify whether any proceedings had been initiated to investigate Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing.", "38.  On 27 November 2007 the applicant complained to the town prosecutor that he had not been informed of any decisions in respect of the complaint concerning his nephew\u2019s killing.", "39.  On 6 December 2007 the town prosecutor replied to the applicant that the decision to terminate proceedings in criminal case no. 27520028 had been overruled as unlawful and the proceedings resumed on 6 December 2007. The letter did not specify whether any proceedings had been initiated in respect of an investigation of Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing.", "40.  On 6 March 2008 the applicant again complained to the Karabulak investigating committee about Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing, and stressed that according to numerous witnesses his nephew had not been armed and had not offered resistance to FSB officers. However, none of those eyewitnesses had been interviewed and no criminal proceedings had been instituted in connection with his death. The applicant further stated that he had in the meantime been provided with the decision of 2 November 2007 and that the town prosecutor had overruled it as unfounded. The applicant requested the investigating department to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the killing and to question the FSB officers who had participated in the arrest of his nephew, the OMON and police officers and other eyewitnesses. He also asked the investigators to grant him victim status in those proceedings. The applicant\u2019s complaint was received by the investigating department on 19 March 2008 but no reply was given to it.", "41.  On 14 August 2008 the applicant complained to the Karabulak District Court under Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure about the failure of the investigating department to open a criminal case in connection with Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing and failure to take basic steps to establish the circumstances of the incident. In his complaint the applicant stated, amongst other things, the following:\n\u201c... On 2 September 2007 ... officers of law-enforcement bodies shot and killed my nephew Mr Apti Dalakov, who, according to eye-witnesses, was not armed and did not resist.\nI lodged a request with the Ingushetia Prosecutor asking for a criminal case to be opened in connection with the killing. In reply I received the decision to terminate the investigation in criminal case no. 2750028 opened against Mr Apti Dalakov.\nThe Karabulak Town Prosecutor overruled this decision ... I lodged another complaint with the Karabulak Investigating Department in which I requested that a criminal case be opened in order to investigate the killing of Mr Apti Dalakov; witnesses to the incident, in addition to the police officers from the Karabulak Town Police Department and the Ingushetia OMON who had participated in the detention of the FSB officers who had shot Mr Apti Dalakov, be identified and questioned ... and victim status in the criminal case be granted to me. This complaint was delivered on 19 March 2008.\nAccording to ... the Russian Criminal Procedure Code, my complaint should have served as the reason for opening of a criminal case ... a criminal case is opened when there is sufficient evidence that a crime has been committed... and the decision is taken within ten days from the receipt of the complaint...\nHowever, those regulations were not complied with. The investigating authorities received my complaint, but they neither took any appropriate decisions nor informed me thereof. This procedural violation led to the failure to take the other steps I had requested in my complaint.\nWitnesses to the incident, who could have confirmed Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing and refuted the allegations that he had resisted arrest, have not been identified or questioned. We ourselves have identified such witnesses, including Mr [M.Ku.], Mr [I.Ma.], and others.\nThe police officers from the Karabulak Town Police Department and the Ingushetia OMON who had arrested the individuals, who shot Mr Apti Dalakov were not questioned. I was not granted victim status either.\nThe failure of the investigating authorities to act violates Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights...\nI request, on the basis of Article 125 of the Russian Criminal Procedure Code that the court ... 1.  Declare unlawful the failure of the investigating authorities to initiate a criminal investigation in respect of my complaint, to identify and question witnesses to the killing ... and grant me victim status in the proceedings; 2.  Oblige the Karabulak Investigating Committee\n(1)  to remedy the above breaches;\n(2)  to open a criminal case in connection with Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing\n(3)  to grant me victim status in the criminal case\n(4)  to identify and question witnesses to Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing\n(5)  to question officers of the Karabulak Town Police Department and the Ingushetia OMON who arrested those involved in Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing ...\u201d\nAccording to the Government, the applicant lodged this complaint on 18 August 2008. The incoming mail registration stamp on the copy of the document indicates that this complaint was received on 14 August 2008.", "42.  On 18 September 2008 the District Court held a hearing in connection with the applicant\u2019s complaint. According to the transcript of the hearing, both parties were present. During the examination the representative of the investigating authorities submitted that they had transferred the evidence concerning the killing of Mr Apti Dalakov to a military prosecutor\u2019s office. The judge requested that the documents reflecting the transfer be provided for the next hearing, scheduled for 23 September 2008.", "43.  On 23 September 2008 the District Court examined and rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint as unsubstantiated. The court reasoned as follows:\n\u201c... [the applicant] M. K. Dalakov ... requested that his complaint be allowed and the refusal to initiate a criminal investigation into his nephew\u2019s killing be declared unlawful ... that the police officers ... who had been present at the crime scene be questioned as witnesses, and that more witnesses to the crime, in addition to the FSB officers who had shot Mr A. Dalakov dead, be identified and questioned.\nThe public prosecutor Mr [A. P.] requested the court to reject the complaint as unsubstantiated. In support of his position he stated that the criminal case related to Mr A. Dalakov\u2019s death had been terminated by the Karabulak Investigating Committee, as the actions of the FSB officers who had carried out the operation in respect of Mr A. Dalakov had been declared lawful. The OMON police officers on whose questioning the applicant insists before the court arrived at the scene later and did not witness Mr A. Dalakov\u2019s killing. No other witnesses were identified.\nHaving been duly informed of the date and place of the hearing, and in the absence of requests for the examination of the case in their absence, both parties failed to appear at the hearing; this does not preclude the court from examining the complaint on its merits.\nThe court finds the applicant\u2019s and his lawyer\u2019s allegations unsubstantiated, as they are not properly argued and are not supported by appropriate evidence.\nOn the basis of the above, under paragraph 5 of Article 125 of the Russian Criminal Procedure Code, the court finds that the complaint of Mr Magomed Dalakov under Article 125 of the Russian Criminal Procedure Code concerning alleged failure of the Karabulak Investigating Committee to act should be rejected ...\u201d", "44.  According to the Government\u2019s submission, both parties were present during the examination on 18 and 23 September 2008. The applicant, who was represented at the hearing by his lawyer, was provided with a copy of the decision by letter from the court, sent to his address on the same date. The Government provided a copy of that letter without an envelope, bearing the applicant\u2019s address in Karabulak and dated 23 September 2008.", "45.  According to the applicant\u2019s submission, on 23 September 2008 no examination of the complaint took place and, therefore, he was not informed of any decisions taken on that date and did not receive the decision by post. The applicant stated that prior to the hearing of 23 September 2008 his lawyer had been informed in person that the hearing had been rescheduled for an unspecified date. Subsequently, the lawyer repeatedly enquired with the court by telephone and in person about the examination of the complaint. In reply to his queries he was assured that he would be apprised of the date and venue of the examination. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer was provided with a copy of the decision of 23 September 2008.", "46.  In the applicant\u2019s submission, the court\u2019s decision allegedly taken on 23 September 2008 was backdated, and had in fact been prepared at a later date. In particular, he pointed out that the text of the decision and the transcript of the hearing allegedly held on that date contained inconsistencies. In particular, according to the transcript, both parties, including the applicant\u2019s lawyer, had been present at the hearing and the delivery of the decision by the judge. However, in the text of the decision of 23 September 2008 it was stated, amongst other things, that neither party had appeared at the hearing (see paragraph 42 above).", "47.  According to the applicant, on 30 November 2008 his lawyer telephoned the court and was informed that the examination of his complaint had again been rescheduled as the judge had gone on holiday.", "48.  On 9 April 2009 the applicant wrote to the military investigating department, asking whether they had returned to the town prosecutor\u2019s office the materials concerning Mr Apti Dalakov\u2019s killing (see paragraph 42 above). No reply was given to that request.", "49.  On 16 April 2009 the applicant\u2019s lawyer complained to the Ingushetia Supreme Court. The text of the complaint included the following:\n\u201c... M.

The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Konstancin Jeziorna.", "8.  On 27 December 2002 the Gazeta Wyborcza \u2013 a major daily newspaper \u2013 published an article with the headline: \u201cA law in exchange for a bribe: when Rywin pops by to see Michnik\u201d (Ustawa za \u0142ap\u00f3wke, czyli przychodzi Rywin do Michnika).\nThe article was about bribery in connection with the legislative procedure for the amendment of the Broadcasting Act. According to the article, in July 2002 Lew Rywin (the applicant), a well-known film producer, had offered a bribe to representatives of the company that published the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, Agora S.A. The applicant was said to have been acting on the instructions of a purported \u201cgroup in power\u201d (grupa trzymaj\u0105ca w\u0142adze), which allegedly included certain high-ranking State officials, among them the Prime Minister. More specifically, the applicant had reportedly offered the representatives of Agora his assistance in amending the Broadcasting Act so that the company could buy the private television channel Polsat, and had asked for the following, among other things, in return: payment of 17.5 million United States dollars (USD), his appointment as chairman of the channel Polsat and an undertaking from the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza to refrain from publishing any criticism of the government. The above-mentioned proposal was said to have been made by the applicant during a meeting with Adam Michnik, editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborcza. The meeting had been recorded by the latter and transcriptions from the recording were later included in the article published by his newspaper.", "9.  After the case was revealed in the press, the public prosecutor at the Warsaw Court of Appeal brought proceedings against the applicant, on 31 December 2002, on a charge of influence peddling (przest\u0119pstwo p\u0142atnej protekcji), under Article 230 of the Criminal Code.", "10.  On 10 January 2003, the Sejm \u2013 lower house of Parliament \u2013 passed a resolution (uchwa\u0142a) setting up a parliamentary commission of inquiry (\u201cthe commission\u201d). Under that resolution the commission was set up with the following aims:\n\u201c(1) To investigate the circumstances surrounding the attempted extortion by Lew Rywin of material and political gains in exchange for his assistance in preventing an amendment of the Broadcasting Act that would be unfavourable to private media and in guaranteeing that the Broadcasting Media Council would decide in favour of such media; and to determine the identity of any persons that may have taken steps to this effect, as revealed by the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper and other media.\n(2) To examine, in the light of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the parliamentary procedure for the amendment of the Broadcasting Act.\n(3) To examine whether the authorities\u2019 response to the media revelations concerning the affair mentioned under point 1 above was regular.\u201d\nThe resolution stated that the commission\u2019s meetings would be held in public, unless otherwise provided by law or by the Sejm\u2019s rules of procedure.", "11.  On 14 January 2003, the commission, consisting of ten MPs, began its work.", "12.  On the same day the public prosecutor questioned the applicant and notified him of the charge against him. The applicant was obliged to present security in the form of a registered charge against his property and his passport was seized.", "13.  On 23 February 2003 issue number 8 of the weekly magazine Wprost was published with, on the cover, a photomontage showing the applicant with his head emerging from a toilet bowl while three hands of unknown persons were pressing the flush button. The photomontage was accompanied by the following caption: \u201cHow many men in power will Rywin bring down with him?\u201d (Ilu ludzi wladzy pociagnie za soba Rywin ?). Inside the same issue of Wprost was an article headed \u201cRywinotherapy\u201d (Rywinoterapia), on the subject of corruption in Poland.", "14.  Following that publication the applicant brought proceedings against Wprost for the protection of his reputation, complaining about a breach of his right to be presumed innocent.\nOn 25 June 2003 Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim, finding in particular as follows:\n\u201cUntil the final conviction has been handed down, the complainant must be treated as a person presumed innocent. It is nevertheless true that he had been charged with specific offences, that a bill of indictment had been preferred against him, and that the matter is being examined by a parliamentary commission of inquiry. It must be emphasised that the general public have been informed about the \u201cgroup in power\u201d [sic]. In that situation, the journalists had not only the right but also a duty, under the Press Act, to ask questions about any figures in power who may be implicated in this affair ...\nIn the lower court\u2019s opinion, the complainant\u2019s picture was widely known to the public in the context of the \u2018Rywin affair\u2019 even before the article was published. The image of Lew Rywin had appeared on a number of occasions in the media in connection with this matter. The complainant was interviewed by the parliamentary commission of inquiry in the course of hearings that were broadcast on television. Having regard to this context, the publication by the weekly Wprost of the applicant\u2019s picture did not harm his reputation.\n...\nWhat is important in the present case is the fact that the cover does not contain any material that may prejudge the complainant\u2019s guilt in [what is known as] the \u2018Rywin\u2019 affair. According to the court below, the cover may be seen by readers as a [mere] indication that the complainant was involved in the case. His implication in this affair, of which the public were well-informed before the impugned publication, is therefore not attributable to the latter. ...\nThe seriousness of the bribery justified, in the present instance, the use of scathing expressions and very expressive symbols. ... Bribery is so harmful and blameworthy that the fact of representing it using a toilet bowl as a symbol is no exaggeration ... The picture where the complainant\u2019s head is seen emerging from the toilet bowl \u2013 a symbol of corruption \u2013 only means that he may be implicated in the affair and that its elucidation may lead to establishing the identities of others involved ...\u201d", "15.  In the meantime, the criminal investigation and the work of the commission were ongoing. The commission sat throughout 2003 and until 5 April 2004, when its last session was convened.\nThe sessions held by the commission between 8 February and 21 November 2003 were devoted to the hearing of witnesses, such as the executives of Agora, high-ranking government officials starting with the Prime Minister, journalists, members of the Warsaw public prosecutor\u2019s office and businessmen representing the media. The applicant, who appeared before the commission on 22 February 2003, refused to answer any of its questions. The commission\u2019s hearings were public and broadcast live on radio and television. Only two of the witness hearings were apparently held in private. The transcripts of the commission\u2019s hearings, consisting of more than 8,000 typed pages, were systematically published on the Parliament\u2019s website.", "16.  The commission\u2019s work was widely reported in the media, including comments by its members.", "17.  Pursuant to the Parliamentary Commissions of Inquiry Act (see paragraph 83 below), the commission worked in close cooperation with the Warsaw public prosecutor conducting the criminal investigation in respect of the applicant.\nThus in February 2003 the president of the commission asked the public prosecutor\u2019s office to conduct certain investigative acts, and in particular: to obtain the transcripts of the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations; to determine the places where his documents were kept; to seize the hard drives from his computer; and to carry out a search of his private and professional premises.\nOn 6 February 2003 the public prosecutor conducting the investigation authorised the commission to disclose, in the context of the proceedings before it, the material in the criminal investigation file. On 6 March 2003 the national public prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against this measure, observing that the disclosure of such material was authorised provided it was not prejudicial to the outcome of the case.\nOn 24 March 2003 the commission forwarded to the public prosecutor, at his request, the transcripts and recordings of its hearings, including the witness hearings.", "18.  Information was exchanged between the commission and the public prosecutor on several occasions. In that connection, members of the commission\u2019s presidium had meetings with the national public prosecutor and the public prosecutor leading the investigation.", "19.  In June 2003 the criminal investigation in respect of the applicant was completed and the indictment, together with a case file of eighteen volumes, was presented to Warsaw District Court. Mr Rywin was indicted for attempted influence peddling, an offence under Article 230 of the Criminal Code combined with Article 12 of the same Code.", "20.  On 8 August 2003 the Warsaw Court of Appeal ordered the case to be sent to Warsaw Regional Court on the ground of its exceptional nature and its importance (sprawa szczeg\u00f3lnej wagi), having regard to the positions held by the individuals implicated in the case, the media and public interest and the work of the commission.", "21.  On 6 October 2003 Warsaw Regional Court declared that the public prosecutor\u2019s decision of 6 February 2003 (see paragraph 17 above) applied to the judicial phase of the criminal proceedings.\nNoting that the commission had been privy to the whole of the investigation case file concerning the applicant, the court pointed out that if the material in the file were used in the proceedings before the commission it would have to be careful not to cause any prejudice to the persons concerned by that investigation, such as the witnesses and the applicant.", "22.  On 20 October 2003 the case was assigned to a bench of three professional judges.", "23.  On 2 December 2003, when the trial opened, Warsaw Regional Court authorised the broadcasting of the hearings live on radio and television, emphasising that journalists should not impede the smooth running of the proceedings and should abide by the rule that testifying witnesses were not to be apprised of the statements of the other witnesses.\nThe court also authorised the media disclosure of the applicant\u2019s identity and picture, observing that the public interest in following the proceedings prevailed over any contrary interest of the persons on trial.", "24.  Warsaw Regional Court heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including those who had already been interviewed by the commission. During these hearings, the court systematically compared the statements before it with those that the same witnesses had given to the commission.", "25.  The Regional Court and the commission exchanged, on a number of occasions, information they had gathered in their respective proceedings.", "26.  On 31 March 2004, after the closing of the witness hearings, the court made public all the evidence, including that which it had received from the commission.\nThe court informed the parties that there might be a change in the legal classification of the charges against the applicant, which might fall under Article 13 \u00a7 1 combined with Article 286 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code, corresponding to the offence of attempted fraud (usi\u0142owanie doprowadzenia do niekorzystnego rozporzadzenia mieniem).\nIn response to a request by the defence for the adjournment of the proceedings for a maximum of one week, the court postponed the trial until 14 April 2004, fixing 16 April 2014 as the date of the last round of oral argument.", "27.  On 14 April 2004 the court rejected a defence request for the admission of new evidence.\nIn response to a request by the defence, the court then adjourned the trial until 20 April, declaring that judgment would be given on 26 April.", "28.  On 21 April 2004 the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza published an article with the heading \u201cBefore the judgment\u201d (\u201cPrzed wyrokiem\u201d), beginning as follows:\n\u201cThe biggest corruption scandal of the Third Republic will certainly end in a failure for the justice system \u2013 regardless of the charges on which Lew Rywin is convicted or the sentence handed down.\n... I think that the judgment will be disappointing in terms of the intention and capacity of the justice system to succeed in discovering the truth \u2013 this indeed being the mission of the courts and the public prosecutor \u2013 beyond the politics. After the Rywin affair, citizens will still be convinced that laws are not enacted but purchased and that even the high-ranking officials of the State \u2013 and I quote the public prosecutor \u2013 \u2018place their personal interests above those of society\u2019; in other words \u2013 to call a spade a space \u2013 [that they] are corrupt.\n...\u201d", "29.  In a judgment of 26 April 2004 Warsaw Regional Court found the applicant guilty of attempted fraud, under Article 13 of the Criminal Code combined with Article 286 \u00a7 1, Article 294 \u00a7 1 and Article 12 of the same Code, and sentenced him to two years and six months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 zlotys (PLN). In its reasoning the court found as follows:\n(a) that it was established that between 15 and 22 July 2002, the applicant had attempted to incite Wanda Rapaczy\u0144ska, chair of Agora\u2019s board of directors, and Adam Michnik, editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborcza, to dispose of that company\u2019s property with detrimental effect thereto for a value equivalent to USD 17.5 million;\n(b) that it had not been established that the applicant had been instructed by the Prime Minister or any figures in his entourage.\nOne of the judges on the bench submitted a separate opinion, taking the view that the applicant should have been given a suspended sentence with probation, in view of his age, his professional background and his state of health.", "30.  After the delivery of the judgment, the president of the trial court of Warsaw Regional Court published a statement. He commended the efforts of his fellow judges to bring the trial to its conclusion in a calm manner, notwithstanding the various comments about the procedure that had been reported in the media. Noting that some of those comments could be regarded as an attempt to influence the court\u2019s work, the president emphasised the following points: that throughout the trial the judges had acted pursuant only to the provisions of criminal law; that the purpose of the trial was different from that of the parliamentary commission of inquiry; and that as professional judges the members of the bench had been able to resist any pressure that might result from the media statements made in connection with the case by various journalists and politicians, or even by certain members of the commission. Pointing out that a statement such as his in the present case was unusual, in view of the judiciary\u2019s duty of discretion, the president explained that he could not refrain from mentioning the remarks made by the author of the article entitled \u201cBefore the judgment\u201d, which had been published in the period when the case was under deliberation and which could be regarded, in his view, as an attempt on the part of the journalist to influence the outcome; such statements were, in his view, inadmissible and blameworthy, even in connection with a case which, like the present one and rightly so, had attracted significant media interest.", "31.  On 23 August 2004 the applicant and the public prosecutor\u2019s office each appealed against the judgment of 26 April 2004. In his statement of appeal the applicant alleged, among other things, that on account of the influence of the commission\u2019s work on the judges, exacerbated by the press coverage of the two sets of proceedings, his trial had been devoid of the requisite fairness under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.", "32. At the end of its last session on 5 April 2004, the commission adopted its final report, concluding that the applicant had acted alone. Several commission members submitted their own draft reports to the Sejm. After examining it at the plenary of 28 May 2004, the Sejm rejected the commission\u2019s report and expressed its preference for that of the MP Zbigniew Ziobro, which was regarded as the most radical. It can be seen from the file that this report was drafted with a view to having the persons concerned held to account before the Tribunal of State. In view of doubts as to the weight of the vote of 28 May, the Sejm endorsed the report by the MP Zbigniew Ziobro by its final vote of 24 September 2004. The position taken in that report was as follows:\n\u201cLeszek Miller, Prime Minister, Aleksandra Jakubowska, junior minister in the Ministry of Culture, Lech Nikolski, the Prime Minister\u2019s chief of staff, Robert Kwiatkowski, chair of the board of directors of the company TVP S.A., and Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, member of the Broadcasting Media Council, committed, by deliberate and concerted action in July 2002, the offence of bribery, within the meaning of Article 228 \u00a7 5 of the Criminal Code taken together with Article 13 \u00a7 1 thereof; in that they, [while] influencing the content of the Broadcasting Act being amended and the parliamentary proceedings related thereto, in July 2002, through the intermediary of Lew Rywin, acting as agent of the \u2018power-holding group\u2019, made a corrupt proposal to the representatives of Agora S.A, namely on 15 July 2002 to Wanda Rapaczy\u0144ska and Piotr Niemczycki and on 22 July 2002 to Adam Michnik, consisting in demanding a financial reward of 17.5 million US dollars (USD), the appointment of Lew Rywin as chairman of the channel Polsat and an undertaking from the company Agora that the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza would refrain from publishing any criticism of the Prime Minister or government. In return, provisions would be inserted in the Broadcasting Act that would be beneficial for Agora, allowing it to purchase the television channel Polsat.\nThe evidence gathered in this case renders highly plausible (w wysokim stopniu uprawdopodabnia) the above-mentioned account, to the extent of justifying the prosecution of the above-named persons.\u201d", "33.  The report, disseminated by the media, was widely discussed and commented on by the various public stakeholders.\n...", "36.  On 23 November 2004 the Court of Appeal informed the parties that the charge against the applicant was likely to be reclassified to aiding and abetting influence peddling (pomocnictwo do p\u0142atnej protekcji), an offence under Article 18 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code taken together with Article 230 of that Code.\nThe Court of Appeal adjourned the proceedings until 8 December 2004 to allow the defence to adapt its strategy to the intended change of classification. On the scheduled date the defence submitted their observations.", "37.  In a judgment of 10 December 2004 the Court of Appeal found Mr Rywin guilty of aiding and abetting influence peddling (pomocnictwo do p\u0142atnej protekcji), an offence under Article 18 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code taken together with Articles 230 and 12 of that Code, and sentenced him to two years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of PLN 100,000.\nIn its reasoning, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant had facilitated the perpetration by other individuals \u2013 whose identity had not been established \u2013 of the offence of bribery. In this connection it found it established that, on 15 and 22 July 2002, the applicant had presented to Wanda Rapaczy\u0144ska and Adam Michnik an offer devised by the above-mentioned individuals who, on the strength of their positions at the level of the State, had proposed their assistance as intermediaries to amend the Broadcasting Act in a manner favourable to Agora, thereby enabling it to purchase the television channel Polsat, in exchange for USD 17.5 million, a sum that was to be paid to the Social Democrat Party (SLD) via the bank account of a company belonging to the applicant.", "38.  In response to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the proceedings of the commission and their media coverage had undermined the fairness of his trial, the Court of Appeal found that this complaint was not substantiated by any tangible evidence; the applicant had not explained concretely how the media reports on the commission\u2019s work had influenced the reasoning of the judges in their deliberations or the outcome of the criminal proceedings, or how the commission\u2019s proceedings and report might have had any impact on the impartiality of the judges or on the reliability of the testimony given before the trial court. The Court of Appeal took the view, in sum, that this was tantamount to implying that only an adjournment of the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the commission\u2019s work could have preserved its fairness. Noting that the courts were frequently confronted with media interest in a given case, the Court of Appeal was of the view that this fact, in itself, did not suffice for the fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant to be called into question.", "39.  As to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the testimony used in support of his conviction had been vitiated by the fact that the witnesses had been heard by the Regional Court after being questioned on the same circumstances by the commission, in public sittings that had received significant media attention, the Court of Appeal regarded it as ill-founded; testimony was always assessed by judges in accordance with the rules in Article 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the light of all the evidence. In the present case, the Court of Appeal could not identify any circumstance that would lead it to believe that the witnesses heard by the Regional Court had been influenced by the content of their previous statements to the commission or by those of other witnesses.", "40.  With reference to the applicant\u2019s complaint that the reasoning of the Regional Court\u2019s judgment was insufficient, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that in certain respects the reasoning had been succinct. Nevertheless, it endorsed that reasoning to a large extent, noting that the Regional Court had examined the relevant aspects of the case and that its conclusion was justified.", "41.  Lastly, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the Regional Court\u2019s refusal to admit in evidence certain items proposed by the defence; the court below had rightly found them superfluous for the outcome of the case. In the view of the Court of Appeal, the exercise of defence rights could not consist in requests made ad infinitum to elucidate the circumstances of the case, and in particular those that were irrelevant for its resolution.", "43.  In a decision (postanowienie) of 20 October 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the two appeals, endorsing the reasoning given by the Court of Appeal. ... 82.

The relevant provisions of the Parliamentary Commissions of Inquiry Act read as follows:\nArticle 8\n\u201c1. The existence of proceedings that are pending or terminated before another public authority does not preclude the opening of proceedings before the commission. 3. Subject to the agreement of the Sejm\u2019s President, the commission may suspend its activities until proceedings pending before another authority are fully or partly terminated. 4. Proceedings before the commission may, in particular, be suspended in the event of a well-founded conviction that the evidence gathered in the proceedings before another body or a decision taken thereby could be useful to it for an in-depth examination of the matter.\u201d\nArticle 14\n\u201c1.

The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows:\nArticle 5\n\u201c\u00a7 1.

The applicant was born in 1943 and is currently detained in Riedstadt Psychiatric Hospital.", "6.  The applicant has previous convictions for rape dating from 1968 and for indecent assault combined with causing bodily harm by dangerous means dating from 1990.", "7.  On 14 January 2002 the Darmstadt Regional Court convicted the applicant of rape combined with the infliction of bodily injury. The judge incorporated a prison term arising from a previous conviction and sentenced him to a total of four years and six months\u2019 imprisonment. Simultaneously, the court ordered the applicant\u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 31 below). It held that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance in his sexual preference taking the form of sadism and found that the commission of further crimes was to be expected. The verdict of the Regional Court was based mainly on the conclusions of a psychiatric expert opinion but also took into account the applicant\u2019s previous conviction for indecent assault in 1990. It also observed that the applicant had tried to subjugate several prostitutes whom he had been seeing in recent years. The Regional Court found that this indicated an evolution in his behaviour. It noted that the applicant had refused psychiatric therapy so far and shared the expert\u2019s opinion that the applicant would not be able to resist his urge to humiliate and abuse women in order to satisfy his sexual drive. The Regional Court concluded that similar crimes were to be expected and the applicant therefore represented a danger to the public.", "8.  The applicant was arrested on the same day and placed in the Haina Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry.", "9.  The applicant\u2019s detention in psychiatric hospitals has been reviewed at regular intervals (compare Articles 67d and 67e of the Criminal Code, see paragraphs 32 and 33, below) and has been extended annually. In the course of the respective proceedings, the courts have requested annual forensic\u2011psychiatric expert opinions on the necessity of his detention in hospital. All expert opinions concluded that the applicant was likely to re\u2011offend.", "10.  On 2 April 2003 the Haina Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry delivered an initial expert opinion, affirming the diagnosis of antisocial behaviour as an adult and abuse of alcohol. However, the expert opinion did not diagnose sexual sadism. Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2012 which is published by the American Psychiatric Association and offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders \u2012 it found that the necessary criteria were not met. It concluded that this diagnosis seemed rather unlikely but could not be absolutely excluded without an extensive and credible sexual anamnesis.", "11.  On 13 May 2004 the applicant was transferred to the Hanau Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry.", "12.  On 21 November 2005 the applicant was examined by an external psychological expert who criticised in detail the diagnosis of sexual sadism during the trial, in particular the lack of information about the applicant\u2019s inner experiences during the onset of the disorder, its further development, and the failure to evaluate his previous offences. The expert concluded that it remained doubtful whether a diagnosis of sexual sadism could be made (\u201cEs bleibt also weiterhin fraglich, inwieweit ein sexueller Sadismus wirklich vorliegt\u201d).", "13.  On 11 December 2006 the Hanau Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry delivered a further expert opinion. Although it mentioned the presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism, it found that this presumption was not tenable in view of the history and the personality structure of the applicant. Even assuming that the applicant might have a sadistic sexual disposition, he experienced this without suffering and had no desire to change. According to the verdict of the trial court, the applicant had probably fulfilled his sexual inclinations with prostitutes in order to avoid being charged with an offence. Neither the files nor his statements revealed the development of an addiction or of a pressing perverted imagination or of pathologic impulsiveness. There was no call for therapy as the applicant neither suffered from his behaviour nor desired to change it. The clinic therefore concluded that the applicant\u2019s committal to hospital had been erroneous.", "14.  On 3 September 2007, on 20 August 2008 and on 18 August 2009 similar forensic psychiatric expert opinions were delivered by the Hanau Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry. Although all of them also mentioned the presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism, they confirmed the previous findings. All the expert opinions concluded that there were no indications for the diagnosis of sexual sadism apart from the facts contained in the verdict of the trial court. In each expert opinion the applicant was described as a classic instance of an erroneous hospital treatment order.", "15.  On 29 December 2009 the applicant refused to be examined by an external psychiatric expert.", "16.  On 26 January 2010 the applicant was transferred to the Haina Forensic-Psychiatric Hospital.", "17.  On 30 September 2008 the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal allowed the re-opening of the criminal proceedings which had been terminated by the judgment of the Darmstadt Regional Court dated 14 January 2002.", "18.  In 2010 the Kassel Regional Court appointed a new external psychiatric expert. The expert concluded that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, subject to the reservation that he had not examined the applicant in person but had based his evaluation on the medical files only. The Kassel Regional Court subsequently dismissed the request to reopen the criminal proceedings. The applicant\u2019s appeal against this dismissal was dismissed.", "19.  On 17 September 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant\u2019s related constitutional complaint without providing reasons (file no. 2 BvR 1364/12).", "20.  On 15 March 2011 the Haina Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry, where the applicant was detained, delivered an expert opinion on the necessity of the applicant\u2019s further detention in hospital. It made the diagnosis of a dissocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse and a presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism. Although it found a high risk that the applicant would re\u2011offend, it confirmed the prior assessment that the applicant represented a classic instance of an erroneous hospital treatment order. This conclusion was drawn from the fact that the applicant\u2019s behaviour during treatment never gave any grounds for diagnosing a mental disorder such as would have been expected from a person suffering from a psychiatric disorder.", "21.  On 24 May 2011 the Darmstadt Regional Court asked the applicant to inform the court whether he agreed to being examined by the external expert Dr. Egg.", "22.  On 29 May 2011 the applicant wrote to the Regional Court and refused a medical examination.", "23.  On 26 July 2011 the Regional Court heard the applicant and his counsel in person as well as a psychological expert from the Haina Clinic for Forensic Psychiatry.", "24.  On 28 July 2011 the Regional Court declined to terminate the applicant\u2019s placement in hospital and refused to release him on probation as the requirements of Article 67 d \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 6 of the Criminal Code were not met (see paragraph 32, below). It explained that detention in a psychiatric hospital could be terminated on the grounds of an erroneous treatment order only if it was established with certainty that the applicant was not suffering from a mental illness warranting his detention under Article 63 of the Criminal Code owing to a diminished criminal responsibility from the very beginning. In this context the Regional Court observed that neither the statement by the psychological expert at the hearing nor the current and prior expert opinions had excluded the possibility that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism, although this diagnosis had been found to be rather unlikely (see paragraphs 10 to 14, above). Furthermore, the court took into account that the applicant had refused to provide credible and full information about his sexual history and had thus rendered a certain diagnosis impossible. It therefore held that a committal to hospital by mistake had not been established beyond doubt. For this reason alone, therefore, the conditions for application of Article 67 d \u00a7 6 of the Criminal Code were not met. Lastly, the Regional Court noted, but explicitly without basing its decision on this fact, that the expert opinion which had been delivered in the course of the re-opening proceedings of the criminal trial had confirmed the diagnosis of sadism.", "25.  In conclusion, the Regional Court found that the applicant could not be released on probation as he had refused investigation of his problems relating to sexuality and violence. The evolution of the applicant\u2019s detention and his lack of awareness regarding his crimes rendered it very probable that he would re-offend.", "26.  On 29 September 2011 the Frankfurt am Main Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Regional Court. It observed that, for exceptional reasons, an examination of the applicant by an external psychiatric expert was not necessary. Such an expert report would have to be based on the files only, since the applicant had announced his refusal of any examination. Under these circumstances the Court of Appeal found that no new conclusions could be expected from such an external expert opinion. Moreover, it found that the applicant\u2019s condition and dangerousness had not changed since his last examination as he had refused to undergo any therapy. The Court of Appeal further rejected the applicant\u2019s allegation that the Regional Court had reproached him for failing to undergo therapy, while the hospital considered him to be an erroneous admission. It held that in any event the root cause of the applicant\u2019s serious sexual crimes should be reappraised through therapy. In its view that would have been a requirement even if the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment. The applicant himself had to bear the consequences of his refusal to participate in any therapy as the hospital offered therapy in order to reappraise the causes of crime even for patients who had been placed in hospital erroneously.", "27.  On 16 August 2012 the Federal Constitutional Court (file no. 2 BvR 2679/11) refused to admit the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint for its consideration without giving any further reasons.", "28.  On 23 April 2014 the Darmstadt Regional Court decided not to suspend the order for the applicant\u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not to grant probation after obtaining an external expert opinion dated 22 February 2014 and having heard the expert and the applicant\u2019s counsel. The expert, who had not examined the applicant in person due to his refusal to permit such examination, found that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance of his sexual preference in the form of sadism and that the commission of further crimes was to be expected.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in St. Gallenkappel, Switzerland.", "7.  Since 2004, the applicant and F.H. have been involved in legal disputes against each other concerning the property rights in 75% of the bearer shares in both EMK stock company (hereinafter \u201cEMK\u201d) and EMK Engineering stock company (\u201cEMK Engineering\u201d), companies resident and registered in Liechtenstein.", "8.  In September 2006 and April 2007 the Regional Court (F\u00fcrstliches Landgericht) ordered by way of an interim measure that F.H.\u2019s entry in the commercial register as a member of the EMK and the EMK Engineering companies\u2019 respective supervisory boards with power to represent those companies may not be cancelled.", "9.  On 10 June 2005 F.H. brought an action against the applicant in the Regional Court. He requested that the court oblige the applicant to hand over a specified number of bearer shares in EMK and in EMK Engineering and establish that the applicant did not hold and had never held any shares in those Liechtenstein companies. The action was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 18 June 2005.", "10.  In a decision dated 15 July 2005 the Regional Court, following a hearing on 14 July 2005, dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection to the Liechtenstein courts\u2019 jurisdiction (file no. 02 CG.2005.163). It found that it had jurisdiction on grounds of location of assets (Verm\u00f6gensgerichtsstand) to decide upon F.H.\u2019s action. The applicant had assets in Liechtenstein, specifically claims for salary and fees against EMK and EMK Engineering, which both had their seat in Liechtenstein. Furthermore, F.H.\u2019s action for restitution of the bearer shares in these corporations was of a pecuniary nature.", "11.  In a decision dated 1 February 2006 the Court of Appeal, in interlocutory proceedings, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal of 6 September 2005 against the Regional Court\u2019s decision of 15 July 2005.", "12.  Following a constitutional complaint of 22 February 2006, on 1 March 2006 the Constitutional Court granted the applicant\u2019s application to have the Court of Appeal\u2019s interlocutory decision be given suspensory effect. It further ordered the Regional Court not to hold any further hearings in the proceedings at issue until the Constitutional Court had taken its decision on the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint.", "13.  On 27 March 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint as ill-founded (file no. StGH 2006/16).", "14.  Following the termination of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court, the Regional Court resumed the proceedings. It heard evidence from the parties, their counsel and twelve witnesses in person in hearings on 31 May, 28 June and 6 September 2007. It further took note of the written submissions of the parties and of numerous documents as well as of the case files in several related proceedings.", "15.  On 22 April 2009 the applicant asked the Regional Court to deliver its judgment, given that the oral proceedings had concluded on 6 September 2007.", "16.  On 28 December 2009 the Regional Court, in a judgment running to 66 pages, upheld F.H.\u2019s action (file no. 02 CG.2007.114). It ordered the applicant to hand over a specified number of bearer shares in EMK and in EMK Engineering to F.H. and declared that the applicant did not hold and had never held shares in those companies.", "17.  Having regard to the evidence before it, the Regional Court considered that F.H.\u2019s submissions regarding the question of who had been the owner of the shares in dispute had been more credible than that of the applicant. It found that the applicant\u2019s mother, I.K., had never obtained ownership of the shares in question as there had not been a sales contract between her and F.H. She had been in possession of the shares in order to make a minority shareholder think that F.H. was no longer holding shares in the companies. The applicant had known this on conclusion of his contract with I.K. transferring the shares to him as a gift in 2003 at the latest. I.K. had not, therefore, been the owner of or authorised to transfer ownership of the shares to the applicant; the latter had not obtained ownership thereof for lack of good faith.", "18.  Following a hearing, on 27 May 2010 the Court of Appeal, endorsing the findings of the Regional Court, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal dated 3 February 2010. It considered that the Regional Court had taken all evidence necessary for its decision. It further rejected new documentary evidence submitted by the applicant to support his allegations as inadmissible for having been submitted out of time in an attempt to protract the proceedings. The judgment was served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 30 June 2010.", "19.  In a judgment and decision dated 13 January 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant on 7 September 2010. It found that the lower courts had not made an error of law in the legal classification of the facts they had established, that they had not failed to take necessary evidence and that they had sufficiently reasoned their judgments. The judgment and decision were served on the applicant\u2019s counsel on 25 January 2011.", "20.  On 18 February 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint (running to eighty pages plus annexes) with the Constitutional Court against the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment and decision. Relying, inter alia, on Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention and on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the applicant complained, in particular, about the length of the proceedings. He stressed that the outcome of the proceedings, to the duration of which he had not contributed, was of vital importance to him as it concerned his means of subsistence. He further submitted in that context that he had not had at his disposal an effective remedy, such as an application to speed up the proceedings, in order to enforce his Convention rights.", "21.  On 3 March 2011 the President of the Constitutional Court granted the applicant\u2019s application to have his complaint given suspensory effect. The court reserved its decision on the costs arguing that the duty to bear the costs depended on the outcome of the main proceedings. The applicant would have only had to bear the decision fee if his constitutional complaint had been dismissed.", "22.  On 24 March 2011 F.H. lodged a submission in reply to the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint.", "23.  On 20 April 2012 the President of the Constitutional Court, B., informed the applicant that he, alongside Judges Bu., Sn., S. and W., would decide on his constitutional complaint in a hearing in camera on 15 May 2012.", "24.  On 8 May 2012 the applicant lodged a complaint alleging bias (running to twenty-seven pages plus annexes) against the five judges of the Constitutional Court called upon to decide on his complaint.", "25.  The applicant argued, in particular, that all of the five challenged judges had taken arbitrary decisions to his disadvantage and in breach of his Convention rights in relation to the previous injunction and other proceedings brought by him, and that the court, which was influenced by the executive, discriminated against foreign nationals such as the applicant.", "26.  The applicant further submitted that, for different reasons, the five judges of the Constitutional Court individually had not been impartial. As regards the court\u2019s President, Judge B., the applicant complained that he had delayed the appointment of the judges who were to decide on his complaint. Moreover, he was a close friend of H., the court\u2019s Vice President and brother of F.H., the party opposing the applicant in the proceedings at issue.", "27.  According to the applicant\u2019s submission, Judge Bu. was biased because he worked for the Government drawing up expert reports on constitutional questions and giving seminars organised by the Government. He further worked with Judge H. on a regular basis.", "28.  Judge Sn., for his part, was not impartial as he was also a professor at the Liechtenstein University and had himself argued in a publication that judges should be appointed for life or for a long single term of office.", "29.  The applicant further stressed that Judge S. was a member of the supervisory board of a state-owned company and was therefore not independent and impartial.", "30.  Finally, Judge W. was a partner in a law firm with a lawyer against whom the applicant had brought proceedings concerning an inheritance. Another lawyer of that firm had already represented EMK and EMK Engineering. Moreover, Judge W. had previously worked as a lawyer in Judge H.\u2019s law firm.", "31.  By a decision of 15 May 2012, the Constitutional Court, with the five judges whom the applicant had challenged for bias comprising the bench, dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaints of bias.", "32.  The Constitutional Court stated that, in accordance with the principle that, if possible, a complaint of bias should not be decided upon by the challenged judge, the challenged judges, respectively, had not participated in the deliberations and the decision on the respective complaint alleging bias against them, which had been decided upon by the four remaining judges.", "33.  The Constitutional Court considered that the fact alone that several of the challenged judges had already taken part in prior decisions finding against the applicant did not suffice to substantiate that there were objectively justified doubts as to their impartiality for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. Moreover, the fact that the judges had been elected for five years did not compromise their impartiality. The applicant further had not substantiated that the executive had influenced the judges of the Constitutional Court in the present proceedings in any way. Nor did the fact that the judges concerned worked together with F.H.\u2019s brother, the Vice President of the Constitutional Court, on a regular basis and were friends of the latter objectively cast doubts on their impartiality.", "34.  On the same day, on 15 May 2012, the Constitutional Court delivered its judgment (file no. StGH 2011/32). It granted the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint in part, finding that the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and under the Liechtenstein Constitution to a decision within a reasonable time had been breached in the proceedings at issue. It ordered that Liechtenstein reimburse the applicant the fee for lodging the constitutional complaint (170 Swiss francs (CHF)) and bear the further court costs, that is to say, the judgment fee (CHF 1,700). It further ordered Liechtenstein to reimburse F.H., who, unlike the applicant, had been represented by counsel in the proceedings before the Constitutional Court, lawyers\u2019 fees of CHF 2,694.40.", "35.  The Constitutional Court found that the total duration of the proceedings alone, which lasted almost seven years after the action of 10 June 2005 had been brought, did not justify the finding of a breach of the right to a decision within a reasonable time. It had to be noted in that context that almost two years had been necessary to deal with the interlocutory proceedings on the Liechtenstein courts\u2019 jurisdiction brought by the applicant himself. Moreover, the courts had generally duly furthered the proceedings. There had only been a delay of two years and three months between the last hearing before the court of first instance on 6 September 2007 and the delivery of the judgment on 28 December 2009. Such a period of inactivity could no longer be considered as reasonable despite the complexity of the proceedings. Therefore, there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "36.  The Constitutional Court noted that Liechtenstein law did not contain any provisions stipulating which consequences should result from a breach of the right to proceedings within a reasonable time. However, it would be utterly unjust if a breach of this constitutional right did not have any consequences as a result of a lack of legislative provisions. There was therefore a gap in the law which had to be filled by way of judicial interpretation. In the Constitutional Court\u2019s view, it was therefore necessary to impose the costs of the proceedings (court costs and lawyers\u2019 fees) upon the State in order to compensate for and redress the breach of the fundamental right at issue. However, the judgment fee could not be imposed on the State as a measure of compensation as Liechtenstein had to bear that cost anyway.", "37.  The Constitutional Court further dismissed the remainder of the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint. It considered that the applicant\u2019s property rights had not been infringed in the proceedings at issue in which the opposing parties had both claimed to be the owner of the shares in question. Moreover, the Liechtenstein courts had been independent tribunals. In particular, F.H.\u2019s brother, the Vice President of the Constitutional Court, had not taken part in the decision-making process of any of the Liechtenstein courts. Moreover, the findings of facts, the assessment of the evidence and the legal reasoning of the lower courts did not disclose any arbitrariness.", "38.

On 16 September 1982 the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. The life sentence was mandatory.", "5.  On 26 April 1996 the applicant was released on licence by virtue of section 23 of the Prison Act (Northern Ireland) 1953.", "6.  On 7 March 1997 the applicant\u2019s licence was revoked by order of the Secretary of State following his arrest for alleged sexual offences, which included acts of indecent assault and gross indecency with two of his nieces, who were aged nine and thirteen at the time.", "7.  The applicant was subsequently charged with the offences but the charges were withdrawn by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 13 January 1998 because it was not considered to be in his nieces\u2019 best interests to give evidence.", "8.  After considering representations made on behalf of the applicant, the Secretary of State decided that his life licence should not be reinstated and that his case should be considered by the Life Sentence Review Board. The role of the Board, which consisted largely of senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office, was to advise the Secretary of State on when he should release on licence under section 23 of the 1953 Act prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for life. In considering these cases the Board took into account the nature of the prisoner\u2019s offence, his age and background, his response in prison, and all other relevant factors, including the comments made by the trial judge when passing sentence.", "9.  The applicant\u2019s case was reviewed by the Board on 12 November 1998, 3 November 1999, 7 December 1999, 26 April 2000 and 30 October 2000. On each occasion the Board declined to direct his release as it believed that he had committed the conduct alleged against him and that there was a risk he would commit further acts of a similar nature if released.", "10.  The applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decisions of 7 December 1999 and 30 October 2000 on the grounds, inter alia, that the decisions were contrary to Articles 5 \u00a7 4 and 6 of the Convention because the proceedings before the Board had not been \u201cfair\u201d and its function was \u201cadministrative rather than quasi-judicial\u201d.", "11.  Permission was granted but the application was dismissed on 29 June 2001. Insofar as the applicant had sought to rely on Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the court, having regard to Wynne v. the United Kingdom, 18 July 1994, Series A no. 294\u2011A, found that at the relevant time it did not apply to a mandatory life sentence in Northern Ireland.", "12.  The applicant did not seek permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.", "13.  Following a review in anticipation of the coming into force, in October 2000, of the Human Rights Act 1998, the Life Sentence Review Commissioners (\u201cthe LSRC\u201d) replaced the Life Sentence Review Board. Unlike the Board, the LSRC was independent of the Executive and could give legally binding decisions in relation to the release of prisoners.", "14.  On 29 November 2001 the applicant\u2019s case was referred to a panel of the LSRC. The panel\u2019s role was first, to establish whether, at the date of recall, there had been a significant risk of the applicant committing serious harm; and secondly, to consider whether the risk currently posed by the applicant was capable of being managed safely in the community, and, if not, whether there were steps that might be taken with a view to reducing the current risk to a level that could, in the future, be safely managed in the community.", "15.  An initial hearing took place on 17 June 2002. At the hearing the applicant\u2019s solicitor indicated that he had no more factual evidence to adduce concerning the allegations of sexual abuse and asked the panel to conduct a paper review of the credibility of those allegations. The panel agreed and, based on the written material, concluded that on the balance of probabilities the applicant had committed the alleged sexual assaults. It therefore set that issue aside and the remainder of the hearing only addressed the question of risk at that point in time.", "16.  In the course of the hearing the applicant dismissed his solicitor. The hearing was then adjourned as the applicant had no legal representative. He instructed new solicitors in late September 2002 but they only obtained a legal aid certificate in April 2003, despite the Chairman of the panel intervening to expedite the process.", "17.  The panel requested submission of evidence and representations by 31 July 2003. An extension was granted at the applicant\u2019s request and the representations were filed on 17 September 2003. In those representations, the applicant submitted, inter alia, that in a recall case the panel was required to conduct a merits review of the recall decision. He therefore argued that the decision arrived at on paper on 17 June 2002 \u2013 that on the balance of probabilities he had committed the alleged sexual assaults \u2013 had been unlawfully and unfairly arrived at and the question should be revisited by a fresh panel.", "18.  At a hearing on 9 January 2004 the Chairman indicated that he would allow the applicant to reopen the issue of whether or not he had committed the alleged assaults. As a consequence, the panel members recused themselves on 12 January 2004 and a new panel, chaired by Mr Peter Smith QC, was appointed (\u201cthe Smith panel\u201d).", "19.  A preliminary hearing date was fixed for 16 March 2004. At the hearing the Secretary of State indicated that he would not be calling the two complainants as witnesses, although he did intend to tender the transcripts of video-recorded interviews with them. The applicant\u2019s representatives asked the Chairman to direct the Secretary of State to call them as witnesses. The Chairman refused this application but made it clear that the applicant could subpoena the complainants and cross-examine them as though they were witnesses for the Secretary of State. He assured the applicant that no adverse inferences would follow if he did not summons the witnesses.", "20.  The substantive hearing was fixed for 18 and 19 May 2004. On 12 May 2004 the Prison Service on behalf of the Secretary of State submitted twenty-one witness statements taken by police during the course of the original investigation and sought leave to call one of the complainants as a witness. On 14 May 2004 the Smith panel issued a direction permitting the supplementary material to be appended to the hearing materials and granting the Secretary of State permission to call the complainant.", "21.  On 17 May 2004 the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Smith panel to complain about the late submission of the witness statements and the decision to permit the complainant to be called as a witness.", "22.  As a consequence, a further preliminary hearing was held on the morning of 18 May 2004 instead of the substantive hearing originally planned. At the hearing the applicant was told that the complainant would not be attending and it was decided that the Secretary of State should seek to encourage her to attend voluntarily. In the meantime the hearing was adjourned.", "23.  On 23 August 2004 the applicant wrote directly to the Smith panel to complain about the delays in his case.", "24.  On 21 September 2004 the Smith panel replied to the applicant\u2019s letter, indicating that the Secretary of State was still trying to secure the complainant\u2019s attendance.", "25.  On 8 October 2004 the Secretary of State was \u201cforced to conclude that despite our best efforts [the complainant] is reluctant to give evidence voluntarily to the [panel]\u201d.", "26.  On 4 November 2004 the Smith panel indicated that it would not direct the Secretary of State to issue a witness summons to secure the complainant\u2019s attendance.", "27.  The hearing began on 21 March 2005. Evidence was heard over 21 and 22 March, 23, 24 and 31 May and 1 June 2005, including video recordings of social services\u2019 interviews with the applicant\u2019s nieces. In addition, both parties submitted written representations. In his representations the applicant argued that the evidence of sexual abuse should not have been admitted as he had been unable to cross-examine the complainants.", "28.  Having considered the evidence the Smith panel concluded that the Secretary of State had proved on the balance of probabilities that the applicant had committed the alleged sexual assaults against children and that it was not safe to release him on licence at that point.", "29.  The Smith panel dealt with the applicant\u2019s submissions on the unfairness of the proceedings by noting that:\n\u201c... [counsel for the applicant\u2019s] approach to the issue of [the complainant] being subpoenaed was a perfectly legitimate tactical manoeuvre by which he sought, on the one hand, to characterise the failure to subpoena [the complainant] as unfair, while on the other hand, he sought to avoid being instrumental in securing her attendance at the hearing and giving evidence with the consequent danger of the case against [the applicant] being strengthened. The panel remains of the opinion... that it would have been unreasonable to have directed [the complainant] to be subpoenaed.\u201d", "30.  On 3 November 2005 the applicant applied for permission to seek judicial review of the Smith panel\u2019s decision of 3 August 2005 not to direct his release from prison. He contended first, that the procedure before the LSRC had been unfair and in breach of Articles 5 \u00a7 4 and 6 of the Convention, as the Smith panel had based a finding against him on the statements of witnesses who had not been available to be challenged by cross-examination. Secondly, he submitted that the Smith panel had misdirected itself on the applicable standard of proof. Thirdly, he argued that there had not been a sufficient \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the deprivation of his liberty following his recall and the crime for which he was originally convicted. Finally, the applicant submitted that there had been undue delay by the LSRC in progressing the hearing of the referral and there had accordingly been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.", "31.  Permission for judicial review was granted on 9 November 2005. On 23 May 2006 the High Court dismissed the application. With regard to the question of causal connection, it found that the offences of murder and serious sexual assault were both crimes of violence and the applicant had been recalled to prison on the ground that his actions pointed to an actual or potential threat of harm to members of the public. In relation to the issue of procedural fairness, the court found that no unfairness was caused to the applicant by the decision not to call his nieces as witnesses as he had had the option of subpoenaing them himself. Moreover, the court accepted that the panel had applied the correct standard of proof. Finally, in respect of the question of delay, the court found that the Smith panel had not been in breach of its Article 5 \u00a7 4 obligations as the applicant\u2019s side \u201cwas very largely responsible for the long periods in progressing the matter to the point of a hearing\u201d. Even if the Smith panel had been responsible, the applicant\u2019s detention had not been shown to be unlawful and he had not, therefore, suffered any loss of liberty in consequence of any breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4.", "32.  On 4 July 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal against the judgment of the High Court in which he argued that the Smith panel had misdirected itself as to the standard of proof required to establish the allegations against him; that the procedure before the Smith panel had been unfair and in breach of Articles 5 \u00a7 4 and 6 of the Convention, most notably because the applicant\u2019s nieces should have been required to give evidence; and finally, that there had not been a \u201cspeedy determination\u201d of the lawfulness of his detention. The appeal was heard on 23 April 2007.", "33.  On 6 September 2007 the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment. The court dealt summarily with the issue of delay. Although it noted that the Smith panel was \u201cbeset with a number of problems, not the least of which was the obtaining of legal aid for the appellant\u201d, having examined the chronology furnished by the LSRC it was satisfied that it had acted \u201cwith appropriate dispatch\u201d.", "34.  On the question of fairness the court observed that the applicant had suffered no disadvantage on account of the decision not to subpoena his nieces. He had had the opportunity to summons them as witnesses and cross\u2011examine them as though they were the Secretary of State\u2019s witnesses. In any case, the court found it inconceivable that evidence of this nature should have been ignored when the safety of the public was at stake. It therefore concluded that there had been no unfairness to the applicant.", "35.  However, the Court held that in determining the standard of proof the Smith panel had misdirected itself. The court accordingly quashed the Smith panel\u2019s decision of 3 August 2005 and directed that a fresh decision be taken by a differently constituted panel.", "36.  The applicant\u2019s counsel subsequently filed a further written submission with the Court of Appeal, in which he sought a declaration that the applicant\u2019s detention since 2 October 2000 had been in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He also sought damages in respect of that violation and an order for bail.", "37.  On 5 December 2007, after hearing oral submissions, the court decided not to consider the applicant\u2019s submissions on Article 5 \u00a7 1. It noted that this issue had not been raised in the course of the appeal proceedings and, although it had been included in the initial Order 53 statement (a statement lodged with the judicial review application setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it was sought), it had not been directly in issue before the High Court and the judge had therefore made no findings on it.", "38.  The LSRC was granted permission to appeal to the House of Lords on the issue of the standard of proof. The applicant cross-appealed on several grounds: that the procedure adopted before the Smith panel had been unfair; that he had been detained unlawfully in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention; and that the delay had caused a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4.", "39.  Before the decision of the Court of Appeal the Secretary of State had made a second referral of the applicant\u2019s case to the LSRC as two years had passed since the decision of 3 August 2005. A second panel had been convened to conduct the referral (\u201cthe Garrett panel\u201d). However, following the decision of the Court of Appeal this review could no longer take place. Instead, the initial referral to the LSRC, which took place on 29 November 2001, was revived and a third panel was convened to consider afresh the applicant\u2019s recall (\u201cthe first Rodgers panel\u201d).", "40.  The first Rodgers panel first convened for a hearing on 4 January 2008. It had to consider the same two main issues as the Smith panel: whether there had been a significant risk of the applicant committing serious harm at the date of recall; and whether the risk presently posed by the applicant was capable of being safely managed in the community.", "41.  At a hearing on 4 January 2008 the Governor of the Life Management Unit and a senior psychologist at HMP Maghaberry gave evidence to the Rodgers panel on the question of present risk. Following the hearing the applicant\u2019s solicitors wrote to the Northern Ireland Prison Service, asserting that on the basis of the evidence of these two witnesses the risk posed by the applicant could be managed safely in the community. They therefore asked the first Rodgers panel to conclude that there was no significant risk and argued that any further delay in the determination of the case would be in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.", "42.  At a further hearing on 12 March 2008 several witnesses indicated that they no longer believed the applicant would pose a significant risk to the public. Counsel for the applicant therefore contended that a licence should be issued immediately without waiting for a determination of the outstanding factual issue, namely whether or not the applicant had committed the alleged sexual assaults.", "43.  However, on 20 March 2008 the first Rodgers panel indicated that it was required to hear all the evidence before taking a decision.", "44.  On 1 May 2008 the applicant issued a claim for judicial review challenging this decision of 20 March 2008 by the first Rodger\u2019s panel. He sought an order of mandamus requiring it to come to a decision on the question of his licence; a declaration that his detention since 12 March 2008 had been in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention; and a declaration that the handling of the referral by the Rodgers panel on 12 March 2008 was unlawful and in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.", "45.  At an oral hearing on 9 May 2008 the High Court refused permission to apply for judicial review on the ground that the applicant had not demonstrated an arguable case. In particular, it found the application to be premature, as the first Rodgers panel had not been afforded the opportunity to hear all the relevant evidence in the matter and it would be \u201cincomprehensible\u201d for it to complete its statutory task without doing so. With regard to the issue of delay, the court noted that, while circumstances had prevented the case from proceeding with the expedition which normally attends upon such cases, the evidence as a whole demonstrated that the delays had been necessary and purposeful.", "46.  The applicant filed a notice of appeal against this decision.", "47.  In the interim further hearings before the first Rodgers panel took place on 21 and 27 May 2008.", "48.  On 11 June 2008 the House of Lords allowed the LSRC\u2019s appeal, finding that the Smith panel had not failed to adopt and apply the correct standard of proof, and restored its decision of 3 August 2005. At the same time the House of Lords dismissed the applicant\u2019s cross-appeal (see paragraph 38 above).", "49.  Their Lordships considered that the procedure adopted in respect of the subpoenaing of the complainant had not been unfair because it had not disadvantaged the applicant. Likewise, they agreed with the High Court that there had been a sufficient causal connection between the deprivation of the applicant\u2019s liberty and his original conviction. Their Lordships therefore found that there had been no breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.", "50.  In respect of the Article 5 \u00a7 4 issue, although their Lordships expressed some \u201cdisquiet\u201d at the \u201cextraordinarily long period which elapsed between recall and final decision\u201d, they found \u201cno single gap in the chronology which points to avoidable delay on the part of the Commissioners\u201d. They therefore considered that from 29 November 2001 \u2013 when the matter was first referred to the LSRC \u2013 until 3 August 2005 \u2013 the date of the Smith panel\u2019s decision \u2013 the LSRC had taken reasonable steps to proceed to a hearing and that any delays had been mostly out of its control. In particular, Lord Carswell stated that\n\u201c[32]  It is necessary to bear in mind, first, that the remedy is being sought by the Respondent against the Commissioners, not against the Secretary of State, and that what has to be considered is whether the Commissioners failed to act with proper expedition, not whether the system required overhaul so as to speed up the process in some way. For this reason one must leave out of consideration the period up to November 2001 \u2013 over half of the overall lapse of time \u2013 when the matter was referred to the Commissioners for consideration. One may observe, however, that a good deal of activity took place between March 1997 and November 2001, involving two determinations by the Life Sentences Review Board and an application for judicial review.\n...\n[35].  I am of the view, on consideration of the foregoing summary [of events between November 2001 and August 2005], that the Commissioners took reasonable steps to proceed to a hearing, and that the delays were mostly outside their control. Some of them were attributable to the respondent\u2019s change of legal representation and to requests from his solicitors to extend time over various steps. Some delays were unavoidable, bearing in mind that the panel consisted of part-time members and dates had to be found when they could all attend and the witnesses were available. I conclude accordingly that the Commissioners did not delay unduly at any stage, notwithstanding the very long time that the proceedings took to reach a determination. I therefore would not favour making any declaration of breach of article 5(4) of the Convention.\u201d", "51.  Following the judgment of the House of Lords, the decision of the Smith panel of 3 August 2005 was reinstated and the first Rodgers panel became functus officio. A new panel was appointed; however, in light of the previous involvement of the members of the first Rodgers panel in the applicant\u2019s case those members were appointed to the new panel (the second Rodgers panel). It was not necessary for the second Rodgers panel to re\u2011determine the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s recall in 1997 as this issue had already been determined by the Smith panel. The sole issue was therefore that of current risk.", "52.  A hearing was listed for 7 October 2008. Following the hearing of updated evidence, the second Rodgers panel directed that the applicant be released on licence subject to conditions.", "53.  In the meantime, the Court of Appeal had allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the High Court\u2019s refusal to grant permission to apply for judicial review of the first Rodgers panel\u2019s decision of 20 March 2008 (see paragraph 46 above). The judicial review application was remitted to the High Court.", "54.  On 23 January 2009 the High Court refused the applicant\u2019s application for judicial review. Insofar as the applicant had relied on Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the court found that the first Rodgers panel had been entitled to refuse to reach a conclusion on risk until they had heard the further evidence as to the basis of the recall. There had therefore remained a causal connection between the original conviction and the risk of harm to the community which justified the detention of the applicant in March 2008. In respect of his Article 5 \u00a7 4 arguments, the court found that there had been no absence of consideration or periodic review of the applicant\u2019s detention.", "55.  On 14 June 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against this decision. On the Article 5 \u00a7 4 issue \u2013 namely, whether the evidence of risk before the first Rodgers panel in March 2008 must inevitably have led it to the conclusion that the applicant\u2019s detention was no longer necessary for the protection of the public \u2013, the court noted that the evidence of the witnesses with regard to the risk the applicant posed had not been uniform and the panel had therefore been entitled to reach the decision that it did. Consequently the applicant\u2019s continued detention between March and October 2008 had not been arbitrary and was rationally connected to the reason for his recall and sentence.", "56.  On the advice of counsel given on 20 June 2011 the applicant did not pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court."], "applicants": ["DOHERTY"], "defendants": ["UNITED KINGDOM"], "allegedly_violated_articles": ["5"], "violated_articles": ["5"], "court_assessment_references": {"5": ["10", "15", "16", "19", "31", "33", "50", "55", "60", "68"]}, "silver_rationales": [6, 11, 12, 15, 27, 29, 46, 51], "gold_rationales": []}
