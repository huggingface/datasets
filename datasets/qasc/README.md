    "choices": {
        "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"],
        "text": ["sand", "occurs over a wide range", "forests", "Global warming", "rapid changes occur", "local weather conditions", "measure of motion", "city life"]
    },
    "combinedfact": "Climate is generally described in terms of local weather conditions",
    "fact1": "Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture.",
    "fact2": "Fire behavior is driven by local weather conditions such as winds, temperature and moisture.",
    "formatted_question": "Climate is generally described in terms of what? (A) sand (B) occurs over a wide range (C) forests (D) Global warming (E) rapid changes occur (F) local weather conditions (G) measure of motion (H) city life",
    "id": "3NGI5ARFTT4HNGVWXAMLNBMFA0U1PG",
