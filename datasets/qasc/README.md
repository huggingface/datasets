## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 1.54 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 5.60 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 7.14 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
{
    "answerKey": "F",
    "choices": {
        "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"],
        "text": ["sand", "occurs over a wide range", "forests", "Global warming", "rapid changes occur", "local weather conditions", "measure of motion", "city life"]
    },
    "combinedfact": "Climate is generally described in terms of local weather conditions",
    "fact1": "Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture.",
    "fact2": "Fire behavior is driven by local weather conditions such as winds, temperature and moisture.",
    "formatted_question": "Climate is generally described in terms of what? (A) sand (B) occurs over a wide range (C) forests (D) Global warming (E) rapid changes occur (F) local weather conditions (G) measure of motion (H) city life",
    "id": "3NGI5ARFTT4HNGVWXAMLNBMFA0U1PG",
    "question": "Climate is generally described in terms of what?"
}
```

### Data Fields

#### default
- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `choices`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `text`: a `string` feature.
  - `label`: a `string` feature.
- `answerKey`: a `string` feature.
- `fact1`: a `string` feature.
- `fact2`: a `string` feature.
- `combinedfact`: a `string` feature.
- `formatted_question`: a `string` feature.
