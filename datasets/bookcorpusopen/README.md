### Dataset Summary

Books are a rich source of both fine-grained information, how a character, an object or a scene looks like, as well as high-level semantics, what someone is thinking, feeling and how these states evolve through a story.
This version of bookcorpus has 17868 dataset items (books). Each item contains two fields: title and text. The title is the name of the book (just the file name) while text contains unprocessed book text. The bookcorpus has been prepared by Shawn Presser and is generously hosted by The-Eye. The-Eye is a non-profit, community driven platform dedicated to the archiving and long-term preservation of any and all data including but by no means limited to... websites, books, games, software, video, audio, other digital-obscura and ideas.

This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "text": "\"\\n\\nzONE\\n\\n## The end and the beginning\\n\\nby\\n\\nPhilip F. Blood\\n\\nSMASHWORDS EDITION\\n\\nVersion 3.55\\n\\nPUBLISHED BY:\\n\\nPhi...",
    "title": "zone-the-end-and-the-beginning.epub.txt"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### plain_text
- `title`: a `string` feature.
- `text`: a `string` feature.
