## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stacksample

### Dataset Summary

Dataset with the text of 10% of questions and answers from the Stack Overflow programming Q&A website.

This is organized as three tables:

Questions contains the title, body, creation date, closed date (if applicable), score, and owner ID for all non-deleted Stack Overflow questions whose Id is a multiple of 10.
Answers contains the body, creation date, score, and owner ID for each of the answers to these questions. The ParentId column links back to the Questions table.
Tags contains the tags on each of these questions.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Example projects include:

- Identifying tags from question text
- Predicting whether questions will be upvoted, downvoted, or closed based on their text
- Predicting how long questions will take to answer
- Open Domain Q/A

### Languages

English (en) and Programming Languages.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Datasets of all R questions and all Python questions are also available on Kaggle, but this dataset is especially useful for analyses that span many languages.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

StackOverflow Users.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

This data contains information that can identify individual users of StackOverflow. The information is self-reported.

[Needs More Information]

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

StackOverflow answers are not guarenteed to be safe, secure, or correct. Some answers may purposefully be insecure as is done in this https://stackoverflow.com/a/35571883/5768407 answer from user [`zys`](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5259310/zys), where they show a solution to purposefully bypass Google Play store security checks. Such answers can lead to biased models that use this data and can further propogate unsafe and insecure programming practices.
