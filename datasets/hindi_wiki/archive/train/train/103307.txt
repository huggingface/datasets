गणित के सन्दर्भ में, त्रिकोणमितीय प्रतिस्थापन का अर्थ है, गैर-त्रिकोणमितीय फलनों के स्थान पर त्रिकोणमितीय फलनों को स्थापित करना। इनके उपयोग से कुछ समाकल सरल हो जाते हैं।
प्रतिस्थापन 1. यदि समाकल्य में a2 − x2 हो तो, 
रखें और यह सर्वसमिका प्रयोग करें-
प्रतिस्थापन 2. If the integrand contains a2 + x2, let
and use the identity
  1 + tan 2  ⁡ θ = sec 2  ⁡ θ .  {\displaystyle 1+\tan ^{2}\theta =\sec ^{2}\theta .} 
प्रतिस्थापन 3. If the integrand contains x2 − a2, let
and use the identity
In the integral
we may use
Note that the above step requires that a > 0 and cos > 0; we can choose the a to be the positive square root of a2; and we impose the restriction on θ to be −π/2 < θ < π/2 by using the arcsin function.
For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change. For example, as x goes from 0 to a/2, then sin goes from 0 to 1/2, so θ goes from 0 to π/6. Then we have
Some care is needed when picking the bounds. The integration above requires that −π/2 < θ < π/2, so θ going from 0 to π/6 is the only choice. If we had missed this restriction, we might have picked θ to go from π to 5π/6, which would give us the negative of the result.
In the integral
we may write
so that the integral becomes
.
