This list is in alphabetical order by family name . The position in a Telugu name is complicated. Traditionally, most Telegu family names have been given first, followed by the given name. For men, the two names are often followed by a caste title, such as Reddy, Sastri or Raju. In the 20th century, caste titles have been replaced by secondary given names such as Rao, Babu and Baba. Women may have only two-part names or an extension of the given name, such as Devi or Amma. Christian names follow the same order, but Muslim names often have the family name at the end. Many poets use one- or two-word pen names.
