The concept of a portal originated in the Polish and German Wikipedias. In early 2005, the portal concept was imported to the English Wikipedia and the first Wikiportals were established. Later that year, a special namespace was created for portals.
The idea of a portal is to help readers and/or editors navigate their way through Wikipedia topic areas through pages similar to the Main Page. In essence, portals are useful entry-points to Wikipedia content.
Portals are subject to the five pillars of Wikipedia, and must comply with Wikipedia's core content policies like Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Verifiability.
At present, there are 0 featured portals, of a total of साँचा:Number of portals portals on Wikipedia.
All portals should be listed at the directory of portals, which also details their founding dates and whom you can contact with regard to a particular portal. If you have created a portal, you must list it here. Portal:List of portals lists all portals of reader-ready quality.
Portals are also largely inter-accessible with users able to navigate from one portal to another. Universal features, such as the browsebar, and the portals template, allow for convenient browsing. Moreover, portals are also categorised according to hierarchy. Portals, in most instances, will also link to their Related portals and their Subportals .
While the top-level portals are linked to directly from the Main Page, individual portals are linked by placing {{portal}} on a page. In the main namespace, these templates should be located at the top of an article's talk page, often due to being integrated into WikiProject banner templates. Per WP:ALSO, they may also be placed in the "See also" section of articles.
There is no single standard design for portals, but the most widely used layout is the "box portal". The use of this design is recommended due to the ease with which it can be created and maintained. For further ideas on portal design, browse existing portals and see the featured portals. For step-by-step instructions on how to set up a new portal, refer to the instructions page.
Once you have created the portal, please update {{Number of portals}}.
Most portals contain the following for readers:
You may want to embark on an effort to fill the related categories with appropriate articles if this has not been done already .
Just as with Wikipedia at large, portals can be edited by anyone. However, it is important to pay due regard to the established work of others. Editors are always needed to maintain individual portals; if you would like to participate in the upkeep of a particular portal, note your intention on its talk page, list yourself as a maintainer in the directory of portals, and get to work! 
A WikiProject on Portals has been founded to coordinate portal activity. The current objectives are to develop standards for all portals and to ensure maintenance. Other tasks include the integration and categorisation of portals.
Immediate attention is needed at portals listed in Category:Portals under construction and Category:Portals needing attention.
