Referring to the diagram at the right, the six trigonometric functions of θ are:
The following identities are trivial algebraic consequences of these definitions and the division identity.They rely on multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator of fractions by a variable. Ie,
Or 
Two angles whose sum is π/2 radians are complementary. In the diagram, the angles at vertices A and B are complementary, so we can exchange a and b, and change θ to π/2 − θ, obtaining:
Identity 1:
Proof 1:
Refer to the triangle diagram above. Note that   a 2  + b 2  = h 2   {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=h^{2}} by Pythagorean theorem.
The following two results follow from this and the ratio identities. To obtain the first, divide both sides of   sin 2  ⁡ + cos 2  ⁡ = 1  {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}+\cos ^{2}=1} by   cos 2  ⁡  {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}} ; for the second, divide by   sin 2  ⁡  {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}} .
Similarly
Proof 2:
Differentiating the left-hand side of the identity yields:
Integrating this shows that the original identity is equal to a constant, and this constant can be found by plugging in any arbitrary value of x.
Identity 2:
The following accounts for all three reciprocal functions.
Proof 1:
Refer to the triangle diagram above. Note that   a 2  + b 2  = h 2   {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=h^{2}} by Pythagorean theorem.
Substituting with appropriate functions -
Rearranging gives:
Draw a horizontal line ; mark an origin O. Draw a line from O at an angle   α  {\displaystyle \alpha } above the horizontal line and a second line at an angle   β  {\displaystyle \beta } above that; the angle between the second line and the x-axis is   α + β  {\displaystyle \alpha +\beta } .
Place P on the line defined by   α + β  {\displaystyle \alpha +\beta } at a unit distance from the origin.
Let PQ be a line perpendicular to line defined by angle   α  {\displaystyle \alpha }, drawn from point Q on this line to point P.   ∴  {\displaystyle \therefore } OQP is a right angle.
Let QA be a perpendicular from point A on the x-axis to Q and PB be a perpendicular from point B on the x-axis to P.   ∴  {\displaystyle \therefore } OAQ and OBP are right angles.
Draw QR parallel to the x-axis.
Now angle   R P Q = α  {\displaystyle RPQ=\alpha }  
By substituting   − β  {\displaystyle -\beta } for   β  {\displaystyle \beta } and using Symmetry, we also get:
Another simple "proof" can be given using Euler's formula known from complex analysis:Euler's formula is:
Although it is more precise to say that Euler's formula entails the trigonometric identities, it follows that for angles   α  {\displaystyle \alpha } and   β  {\displaystyle \beta } we have:
Also using the following properties of exponential functions:
Evaluating the product:
Equating real and imaginary parts:
Using the figure above,
By substituting   − β  {\displaystyle -\beta } for   β  {\displaystyle \beta } and using Symmetry, we also get:
Also, using the complementary angle formulae,
From the sine and cosine formulae, we get
Dividing both numerator and denominator by   cos ⁡ α cos ⁡ β  {\displaystyle \cos \alpha \cos \beta }, we get
Subtracting   β  {\displaystyle \beta } from   α  {\displaystyle \alpha }, using   tan ⁡ = − tan ⁡ β  {\displaystyle \tan=-\tan \beta } ,
Similarly from the sine and cosine formulae, we get
Then by dividing both numerator and denominator by   sin ⁡ α sin ⁡ β  {\displaystyle \sin \alpha \sin \beta }, we get
Or, using   cot ⁡ θ =  1 tan ⁡ θ   {\displaystyle \cot \theta ={\frac {1}{\tan \theta }}} ,
Using   cot ⁡ = − cot ⁡ β  {\displaystyle \cot=-\cot \beta } ,
From the angle sum identities, we get
and
The Pythagorean identities give the two alternative forms for the latter of these:
The angle sum identities also give
It can also be proved using Euler's formula
Squaring both sides yields
But replacing the angle with its doubled version, which achieves the same result in the left side of the equation, yields
It follows that
Expanding the square and simplifying on the left hand side of the equation gives
Because the imaginary and real parts have to be the same, we are left with the original identities
and also
The two identities giving the alternative forms for cos 2θ lead to the following equations:
The sign of the square root needs to be chosen properly—note that if π is added to θ, the quantities inside the square roots are unchanged, but the left-hand-sides of the equations change sign. Therefore the correct sign to use depends on the value of θ.
For the tan function, the equation is:
Then multiplying the numerator and denominator inside the square root by and using Pythagorean identities leads to:
Also, if the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by, the result is:
This also gives:
Similar manipulations for the cot function give:
If   ψ  {\displaystyle \psi },   θ  {\displaystyle \theta } and   ϕ  {\displaystyle \phi } are the angles of a triangle, i.e.   ψ + θ + ϕ = π =  {\displaystyle \psi +\theta +\phi =\pi =} half circle,
Proof:
If   ψ + θ + ϕ =  π 2  =  {\displaystyle \psi +\theta +\phi ={\tfrac {\pi }{2}}=} quarter circle,
Proof:
Replace each of   ψ  {\displaystyle \psi },   θ  {\displaystyle \theta }, and   ϕ  {\displaystyle \phi } with their complementary angles, so cotangents turn into tangents and vice-versa.
Given
so the result follows from the triple tangent identity.
First, start with the sum-angle identities:
By adding these together,
Similarly, by subtracting the two sum-angle identities,
Let   α + β = θ  {\displaystyle \alpha +\beta =\theta } and   α − β = ϕ  {\displaystyle \alpha -\beta =\phi } ,
Substitute   θ  {\displaystyle \theta } and   ϕ  {\displaystyle \phi } 
Therefore,
Similarly for cosine, start with the sum-angle identities:
Again, by adding and substracting
Substitute   θ  {\displaystyle \theta } and   ϕ  {\displaystyle \phi } as before,
The figure at the right shows a sector of a circle with radius 1. The sector is θ/ of the whole circle, so its area is θ/2.
The area of triangle OAD is AB/2, or sinθ/2. The area of triangle OCD is CD/2, or tanθ/2.
Since triangle OAD lies completely inside the sector, which in turn lies completely inside triangle OCD, we have
This geometric argument applies if 0π/2, then θ>1. But sinθ≤1, so sinθ<θ. So we have
For negative values of θ we have, by symmetry of the sine function
Hence
Proof: From the previous inequalities, we have, for small angles
Therefore,
Consider the right-hand inequality. Since
Multply through by   cos ⁡ θ  {\displaystyle \cos \theta } 
Combining with the left-hand inequality:
Taking   cos ⁡ θ  {\displaystyle \cos \theta } to the limit as   θ → 0  {\displaystyle \theta \to 0} 
Therefore,
Proof:
The limits of those three quantities are 1, 0, and 1/2, so the resultant limit is zero.
Proof:
As in the preceding proof,
The limits of those three quantities are 1, 1, and 1/2, so the resultant limit is 1/2.
All these functions follow from the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. We can prove for instance the function 
Proof:
We start from
Then we divide this equation by   cos 2  ⁡ θ  {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta } 
Then use the substitution   θ = arctan ⁡  {\displaystyle \theta =\arctan}, also use the Pythagorean trigonometric identity:
Then we use the identity   tan ⁡ ≡ x  {\displaystyle \tan\equiv x}
