    the design of MultiRC, while the latter is a counterpart of the ReCoRD dataset. The datasets are included
    in RussianSuperGLUE, the Russian general language understanding benchmark. We provide a comparative analysis
    and demonstrate that the proposed tasks are relatively more complex as compared to the original ones for English.
    Besides, performance results of human solvers and BERT-based models show that MuSeRC and RuCoS represent a challenge
    for recent advanced neural models. We thus hope to facilitate research in the field of MRC for Russian and prompt
    the study of multi-hop reasoning in a cross-lingual scenario.",

their broad diagnostics and testing for general intellectual skills - detection of natural language inference,
commonsense reasoning, ability to perform simple logical operations regardless of text subject or lexicon. For the first

Textual Entailment Recognition has been proposed recently as a generic task that captures major semantic inference

Depending on its context, an ambiguous word can refer to multiple, potentially unrelated, meanings. Mainstream static

embeddings are an attempt at addressing this limitation by computing dynamic representations for words which can adapt

_RWSD_DESCRIPTION = """\
A Winograd schema is a pair of sentences that differ in only one or two words and that contain an ambiguity that is
resolved in opposite ways in the two sentences and requires the use of world knowledge and reasoning for its resolution.
The schema takes its name from a well-known example by Terry Winograd.
The set would then be presented as a challenge for AI programs, along the lines of the Turing test. The strengths of
the challenge are that it is clear-cut, in that the answer to each schema is a binary choice; vivid, in that it is
obvious to non-experts that a program that fails to get the right answers clearly has serious gaps in its understanding;
and difficult, in that it is far beyond the current state of the art.

DaNetQA is a question answering dataset for yes/no questions. These questions are naturally occurring -- they are

Each example is a triplet of (question, passage, answer), with the title of the page as optional additional context.
The text-pair classification setup is similar to existing natural language inference tasks.

By sampling questions from a distribution of information-seeking queries (rather than prompting annotators for
text pairs), we observe significantly more challenging examples compared to existing NLI datasets.
