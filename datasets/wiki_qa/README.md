## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 6.77 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 6.10 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 12.87 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "answer": "Glacier caves are often called ice caves , but this term is properly used to describe bedrock caves that contain year-round ice.",
    "document_title": "Glacier cave",
    "label": 0,
    "question": "how are glacier caves formed?",
    "question_id": "Q1"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `question_id`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `document_title`: a `string` feature.
- `answer`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `0` (0), `1` (1).
