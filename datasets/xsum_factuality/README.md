### Dataset Summary

Neural abstractive summarization models are highly prone to hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. The popular metric such as ROUGE fails to show the severity of the problem. The dataset consists of faithfulness and factuality annotations of abstractive summaries for the XSum dataset. The dataset has crowdsourced 3 judgements for each of 500 x 5 document-system pairs. This will be a valuable resource to the abstractive summarization community.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

##### Faithfulness annotations dataset

```
{
'bbcid': 34687720,
 'hallucinated_span_end': 114,
 'hallucinated_span_start': 1,
 'hallucination_type': 1,
 'summary': 'rory mcilroy will take a one-shot lead into the final round of the wgc-hsbc champions after carding a three-under',
 'system': 'BERTS2S',
 'worker_id': 'wid_0'
 }
```

##### Factuality annotations dataset

```
{
'bbcid': 29911712,
 'is_factual': 0,
 'summary': 'more than 50 pupils at a bristol academy have been sent home from school because of a lack of uniform.',
 'system': 'BERTS2S',
 'worker_id': 'wid_0'
 }
```

### Data Fields

##### Faithfulness annotations dataset

Raters are shown the news article and the system summary, and are tasked with identifying and annotating the spans that aren't supported by the input article. The file contains the following columns:


- bbcid: Document id in the XSum corpus.
- system: Name of neural summarizer.
- summary: Summary generated by ‘system’.
- hallucination_type: Type of hallucination: intrinsic (0) or extrinsic (1)
- hallucinated_span: Hallucinated span in the ‘summary’.
- hallucinated_span_start: Index of the start of the hallucinated span.
- hallucinated_span_end: Index of the end of the hallucinated span.
- worker_id: 'wid_0', 'wid_1', 'wid_2'


The `hallucination_type` column has NULL value for some entries which have been replaced iwth `-1`.

##### Factuality annotations dataset

Raters are shown the news article and the hallucinated system summary, and are tasked with assessing the summary whether it is factual or not. The file contains the following columns:


- bbcid: Document id in the XSum corpus.
- system: Name of neural summarizer.
- summary: Summary generated by ‘system’.
- is_factual: yes (1) or no (0)
- worker_id: 'wid_0', 'wid_1', 'wid_2'


The `is_factual` column has NULL value for some entries which have been replaced iwth `-1`.
