### Dataset Summary

The dataset consists of parsed Parsed ASTs that were used to train and evaluate the DeepSyn tool. 
The Python programs are collected from GitHub repositories
by removing duplicate files, removing project forks (copy of another existing repository)
,keeping only programs that parse and have at most 30'000 nodes in the AST and 
we aim to remove obfuscated files

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Code Representation, Unsupervised Learning
### Languages

Python
## Dataset Structure  

### Data Instances
A typical datapoint contains an AST of a python program, parsed.   
The main key is `ast` wherein every program's AST is stored.  
 Each children would have,  
`type` which will formulate the type of the node.   
 `children` which enumerates if a given node has children(non-empty list). 
 `value`, if the given node has any hardcoded value(else "N/A").
 An example would be,     
'''
[ {"type":"Module","children":[1,4]},{"type":"Assign","children":[2,3]},{"type":"NameStore","value":"x"},{"type":"Num","value":"7"},    {"type":"Print","children":[5]},      {"type":"BinOpAdd","children":[6,7]},        {"type":"NameLoad","value":"x"},        {"type":"Num","value":"1"} ]
'''
### Data Fields
- `ast`: a list of dictionaries, wherein every dictionary is a node in the Abstract Syntax Tree.
- `type`: explains the type of the node.
- `children`: list of nodes which are children under the given
- `value`: hardcoded value, if the node holds an hardcoded value.

### Data Splits

The data is split into a training and test set.   
The final split sizes are as follow:

|                             | Tain   | Valid |
| -----                       | ------ | ----- |
| py_ast examples| 100000 |  50000 |
