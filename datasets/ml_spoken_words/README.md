### Dataset Summary

Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus is a large and growing audio dataset of spoken
words in 50 languages collectively spoken by over 5 billion people, for academic
research and commercial applications in keyword spotting and spoken term search,
licensed under CC-BY 4.0. The dataset contains more than 340,000 keywords,
totaling 23.4 million 1-second spoken examples (over 6,000 hours). The dataset
has many use cases, ranging from voice-enabled consumer devices to call center
automation. This dataset is generated by applying forced alignment on crowd-sourced sentence-level 
audio to produce per-word timing estimates for extraction.
All alignments are included in the dataset.
