### Dataset Summary

Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus is a large and growing audio dataset of spoken
words in 50 languages collectively spoken by over 5 billion people, for academic
research and commercial applications in keyword spotting and spoken term search,
licensed under CC-BY 4.0. The dataset contains more than 340,000 keywords,
totaling 23.4 million 1-second spoken examples (over 6,000 hours). The dataset
has many use cases, ranging from voice-enabled consumer devices to call center
automation. This dataset is generated by applying forced alignment on crowd-sourced sentence-level 
audio to produce per-word timing estimates for extraction.
All alignments are included in the dataset.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Keyword spotting, Spoken term search

### Languages

The dataset is multilingual. To specify several languages to downloading pass a list of them to the
`language` argument:

```python
ds = load_dataset("datasets/ml_spoken_words", languages=["ar", "tt", "br"])
```

The dataset contains data for the following languages:

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

```python
{'file': 'абзар_common_voice_tt_17737010.opus',
 'is_valid': True,
 'language': 0,
 'speaker_id': '687025afd5ce033048472754c8d2cb1cf8a617e469866bbdb3746e2bb2194202094a715906f91feb1c546893a5d835347f4869e7def2e360ace6616fb4340e38',
 'gender': 0,
 'keyword': 'абзар',
 'audio': {'path': 'абзар_common_voice_tt_17737010.opus',
  'array': array([2.03458695e-34, 2.03458695e-34, 2.03458695e-34, ...,
         2.03458695e-34, 2.03458695e-34, 2.03458695e-34]),
  'sampling_rate': 48000}}
```

### Data Fields

* file: strinrelative audio path inside the archive **#TODO: change according to the new local path schema?**
* is_valid: if a sample is valid
* language: language of an instance. Makes sense only when providing multiple languages to the 
dataset loader (for example, `load_dataset("ml_spoken_words", languages=["ar", "tt"])`)
* speaker_id: unique id of a speaker. Can be "NA" if an instance is invalid
* gender: speaker gender. Can be one of `["MALE", "FEMALE", "OTHER", "NAN"]`
* keyword: word spoken in a current sample
* audio: a dictionary containing the relative path to the audio file, 
the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. 
Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically 
decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of 
a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. 
Thus, it is important to first query the sample index before the "audio" column, 
i.e. `dataset[0]["audio"]` should always be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`

### Data Splits
