### Dataset Summary

The Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 5,000 test and
2,500 dev pairs for the MultiNLI corpus. The pairs are annotated with textual entailment and translated into
14 languages: French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese,
Hindi, Swahili and Urdu. This results in 112.5k annotated pairs. Each premise can be associated with the
corresponding hypothesis in the 15 languages, summing up to more than 1.5M combinations. The corpus is made to
evaluate how to perform inference in any language (including low-resources ones like Swahili or Urdu) when only
English NLI data is available at training time. One solution is cross-lingual sentence encoding, for which XNLI
is an evaluation benchmark.
The Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark is a benchmark for the evaluation of
the cross-lingual generalization ability of pre-trained multilingual models. It covers 40 typologically diverse languages
(spanning 12 language families) and includes nine tasks that collectively require reasoning about different levels of
syntax and semantics. The languages in XTREME are selected to maximize language diversity, coverage in existing tasks,
and availability of training data. Among these are many under-studied languages, such as the Dravidian languages Tamil
(spoken in southern India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore), Telugu and Malayalam (spoken mainly in southern India), and the
Niger-Congo languages Swahili and Yoruba, spoken in Africa.
