        "description": "\nThe Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 5,000 test and\n2,500 dev pairs for the MultiNLI corpus. The pairs are annotated with textual entailment and translated into\n14 languages: French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese,\nHindi, Swahili and Urdu. This results in 112.5k annotated pairs. Each premise can be associated with the\ncorresponding hypothesis in the 15 languages, summing up to more than 1.5M combinations. The corpus is made to\nevaluate how to perform inference in any language (including low-resources ones like Swahili or Urdu) when only\nEnglish NLI data is available at training time. One solution is cross-lingual sentence encoding, for which XNLI\nis an evaluation benchmark.\nThe Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark is a benchmark for the evaluation of\nthe cross-lingual generalization ability of pre-trained multilingual models. It covers 40 typologically diverse languages\n(spanning 12 language families) and includes nine tasks that collectively require reasoning about different levels of\nsyntax and semantics. The languages in XTREME are selected to maximize language diversity, coverage in existing tasks,\nand availability of training data. Among these are many under-studied languages, such as the Dravidian languages Tamil\n(spoken in southern India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore), Telugu and Malayalam (spoken mainly in southern India), and the\nNiger-Congo languages Swahili and Yoruba, spoken in Africa.\n",

        "description": "Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for consistent annotation of grammar (parts of speech, morphological\nfeatures, and syntactic dependencies) across different human languages. UD is an open community effort with over 200\ncontributors producing more than 100 treebanks in over 70 languages. If you’re new to UD, you should start by reading\nthe first part of the Short Introduction and then browsing the annotation guidelines.\n\nThe Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark is a benchmark for the evaluation of\nthe cross-lingual generalization ability of pre-trained multilingual models. It covers 40 typologically diverse languages\n(spanning 12 language families) and includes nine tasks that collectively require reasoning about different levels of\nsyntax and semantics. The languages in XTREME are selected to maximize language diversity, coverage in existing tasks,\nand availability of training data. Among these are many under-studied languages, such as the Dravidian languages Tamil\n(spoken in southern India, Sri Lanka, and Singapore), Telugu and Malayalam (spoken mainly in southern India), and the\nNiger-Congo languages Swahili and Yoruba, spoken in Africa.\n",
