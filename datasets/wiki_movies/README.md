### Dataset Summary

The WikiMovies dataset consists of roughly 100k (templated) questions over 75k entitiesbased on questions with answers in the open movie database (OMDb). It is the QA part of the Movie Dialog dataset.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- Question Answering

### Languages

The text in the dataset is written in English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

The raw data consists of question answer pairs separated by a tab. Here are 3 examples:
```buildoutcfg
1 what does Grégoire Colin appear in?	Before the Rain
1 Joe Thomas appears in which movies?	The Inbetweeners Movie, The Inbetweeners 2
1 what films did Michelle Trachtenberg star in?	Inspector Gadget, Black Christmas, Ice Princess, Harriet the Spy, The Scribbler
```
It is unclear what the `1` is for at the beginning of each line, but it has been removed in the `Dataset` object.

### Data Fields
Here is an example of the raw data ingested by `Datasets`:
```buildoutcfg
{
'answer': 'Before the Rain', 
'question': 'what does Grégoire Colin appear in?'
}
```
`answer`: a string containing the answer to a corresponding question.
`question`: a string containing the relevant question.

### Data Splits
The data is split into train, test, and dev sets. The split sizes are as follows:

| wiki-entities_qa_* | n examples|
| -----              | ----      |
| train.txt          | 96185     |
| dev.txt            | 10000     |
| test.txt           | 9952      | 

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

WikiMovies was built with the following goals in mind: (i) machine learning techniques should have ample training examples for learning; and (ii) one can analyze easily the performance of different representations of knowledge and break down the results by question type. The datasetcan be downloaded fromhttp://fb.ai/babi
