"""WikiMovies: A Question-Answering dataset that contains raw text alongside a preprocessed knowledge base, in the domain of movies from the Open Movie Database. It is the QA part of the Movie Dialog dataset.
It was built with the following goals in mind: (i) machine learning techniques should have ample training examples for learning; and (ii) one can analyze easily the performance of different representations of knowledge and break down the results by question type. The dataset can be downloaded fromhttp://fb.ai/babi
