### Dataset Summary

The AMI Meeting Corpus consists of 100 hours of meeting recordings. The recordings use a range of signals
synchronized to a common timeline. These include close-talking and far-field microphones, individual and
room-view video cameras, and output from a slide projector and an electronic whiteboard. During the meetings,
the participants also have unsynchronized pens available to them that record what is written. The meetings
were recorded in English using three different rooms with different acoustic properties, and include mostly
non-native speakers.

### Dataset Preprocessing

Individual samples of the AMI dataset contain very large audio files (between 10 and 60 minutes). The dataset should be chunked 
into more samples of shorter length for training. 

The following two mapping functions can be used to chunk the dataset into its segments.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
import librosa


def chunk_audio(batch, sample_rate=16_000):
    new_batch = {
        "audio": [],
        "text": [],
        "speaker": [],
        "lengths": [],
        "word_start_times": [],
        "segment_start_times": [],
    }

    audio, _ = librosa.load(batch["file"][0], sr=sample_rate)

    word_idx = 0
    num_words = len(batch["words"][0])
    for segment_idx in range(len(batch["segment_start_times"][0])):
        words = []
        word_start_times = []
        start_time = batch["segment_start_times"][0][segment_idx]
        end_time = batch["segment_end_times"][0][segment_idx]

        new_batch["audio"].append(audio[int(start_time * sample_rate): int(end_time * sample_rate)])

        while word_idx < num_words and batch["word_start_times"][0][word_idx] < end_time:
            words.append(batch["words"][0][word_idx])
            word_start_times.append(batch["word_start_times"][0][word_idx])
            word_idx += 1

        new_batch["lengths"].append(end_time - start_time)
        new_batch["text"].append(" ".join(words))
        new_batch["speaker"].append(batch["segment_speakers"][0][segment_idx])
        new_batch["word_start_times"].append(word_start_times)

        new_batch["segment_start_times"].append(batch["segment_start_times"][0][segment_idx])

    return new_batch


ami = load_dataset("ami", "headset-single")

ami = ami.map(chunk_audio, batched=True, batch_size=1, remove_columns=ami["train"].column_names)
```

A preprocessed dataset of the config `"headset-single"`can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ami-wav2vec2/ami_headset_single_processed).

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `automatic-speech-recognition`: The dataset can be used to train a model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to transcribe the audio file to written text. The most common evaluation metric is the word error rate (WER). The task does not have an active leaderboard at the moment.

- `speaker-diarization`: The dataset can be used to train model for Speaker Diarization (SD). The model is presented with an audio file and asked to predict which speaker spoke at what time.

### Languages

The audio is in English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances 

A typical data point comprises the path to the audio file (or files in the case of 
the multi-headset or multi-microphone dataset), called `file` and its transcription as 
a list of words, called `words`. Additional information about the `speakers`, the `word_start_time`, `word_end_time`, `segment_start_time`, `segment_end_time` is given.
In addition 

and its transcription, called `text`. Some additional information about the speaker and the passage which contains the transcription is provided.
 
```
{'word_ids': ["ES2004a.D.words1", "ES2004a.D.words2", ...],
 'word_start_times': [0.3700000047683716, 0.949999988079071, ...],
 'word_end_times': [0.949999988079071, 1.5299999713897705, ...],
 'word_speakers': ['A', 'A', ...], 
 'segment_ids': ["ES2004a.sync.1", "ES2004a.sync.2", ...]
 'segment_start_times': [10.944000244140625, 17.618999481201172, ...],
 'segment_end_times': [17.618999481201172, 18.722000122070312, ...],
 'segment_speakers': ['A', 'B', ...], 
 'words', ["hmm", "hmm", ...]
 'channels': [0, 0, ..], 
 'file': "/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/af7e748544004557b35eef8b0522d4fb2c71e004b82ba8b7343913a15def465f"
}
```

### Data Fields

- word_ids: a list of the ids of the words

- word_start_times: a list of the start times of when the words were spoken in seconds

- word_end_times: a list of the end times of when the words were spoken in seconds

- word_speakers: a list of speakers one for each word

- segment_ids: a list of the ids of the segments

- segment_start_times: a list of the start times of when the segments start

- segment_end_times: a list of the start times of when the segments ends

- segment_speakers: a list of speakers one for each segment

- words: a list of all the spoken words

- channels: a list of all channels that were used for each word

- file: a path to the audio file

### Data Splits

The dataset consists of several configurations, each one having train/validation/test splits:

- headset-single: Close talking audio of single headset. This configuration only includes audio belonging to the headset of the person currently speaking.

- headset-multi (4 channels): Close talking audio of four individual headset. This configuration includes audio belonging to four individual headsets. For each annotation there are 4 audio files 0, 1, 2, 3.

- microphone-single: Far field audio of single microphone. This configuration only includes audio belonging the first microphone, *i.e.* 1-1, of the microphone array.

- microphone-multi (8 channels): Far field audio of microphone array. This configuration includes audio of the first microphone array 1-1, 1-2, ..., 1-8.

In general, `headset-single` and `headset-multi` include significantly less noise than 
`microphone-single` and `microphone-multi`.

|                             | Train | Valid | Test |
| -----                       | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| headset-single | 136 (80h) |  18 (9h) | 16 (9h) |
| headset-multi (4 channels) | 136 (320h) |  18 (36h) | 16 (36h) |
| microphone-single | 136 (80h) |  18 (9h) | 16 (9h) |
| microphone-multi (8 channels) | 136 (640h) |  18 (72h) | 16 (72h) |

Note that each sample contains between 10 and 60 minutes of audio data which makes it 
impractical for direct transcription. One should make use of the segment and word start times and end times to chunk the samples into smaller samples of manageable size.
