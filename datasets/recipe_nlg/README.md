### Dataset Summary

RecipeNLG: A Cooking Recipes Dataset for Semi-Structured Text Generation.

While the RecipeNLG dataset is based on the Recipe1M+ dataset, it greatly expands the number of recipes available.
The new dataset provides over 1 million new, preprocessed and deduplicated recipes on top of the Recipe1M+ dataset.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
