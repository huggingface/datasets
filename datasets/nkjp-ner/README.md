### Dataset Summary

A linguistic corpus is a collection of texts where one can find the typical use of a single word or a phrase, as well as their meaning and grammatical function. Nowadays, without access to a language corpus, it has become impossible to do linguistic research, to write dictionaries, grammars and language teaching books, to create search engines sensitive to Polish inflection, machine translation engines and software of advanced language technology. Language corpora have become an essential tool for linguists, but they are also helpful for software engineers, scholars of literature and culture, historians, librarians and other specialists of art and computer sciences.
The manually annotated 1-million word subcorpus of the NJKP, available on GNU GPL v.3
