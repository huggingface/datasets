{"bc2gm_corpus": {"description": "Nineteen teams presented results for the Gene Mention Task at the BioCreative II Workshop. \nIn this task participants designed systems to identify substrings in sentences corresponding to gene name mentions. \nA variety of different methods were used and the results varied with a highest achieved F1 score of 0.8721. \nHere we present brief descriptions of all the methods used and a statistical analysis of the results. \nWe also demonstrate that, by combining the results from all submissions, an F score of 0.9066 is feasible, \nand furthermore that the best result makes use of the lowest scoring submissions.\n\nFor more details, see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2559986/\n\nThe original dataset can be downloaded from: https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/resources/corpora/biocreative-ii-corpus/\nThis dataset has been converted to CoNLL format for NER using the following tool: https://github.com/spyysalo/standoff2conll\n", "citation": "@article{smith2008overview,\n        title={Overview of BioCreative II gene mention recognition},\n        author={Smith, Larry and Tanabe, Lorraine K and nee Ando, Rie Johnson and Kuo, Cheng-Ju and Chung, I-Fang and Hsu, Chun-Nan and Lin, Yu-Shi and Klinger, Roman and Friedrich, Christoph M and Ganchev, Kuzman and others},\n        journal={Genome biology},\n        volume={9},\n        number={S2},\n        pages={S2},\n        year={2008},\n        publisher={Springer}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2559986/", "license": "", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "tokens": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "ner_tags": {"feature": {"num_classes": 3, "names": ["O", "B-GENE", "I-GENE"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "bc2gm_corpus", "config_name": "bc2gm_corpus", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 6095172, "num_examples": 12501, "dataset_name": "bc2gm_corpus"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 1215951, "num_examples": 2501, "dataset_name": "bc2gm_corpus"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 2454621, "num_examples": 5001, "dataset_name": "bc2gm_corpus"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://github.com/spyysalo/bc2gm-corpus/raw/master/conll/train.tsv": {"num_bytes": 2894093, "checksum": "07f696560252dc5a3d47a5cea1ce36b7434865131b5bc4b3a6d1fb02a382ce10"}, "https://github.com/spyysalo/bc2gm-corpus/raw/master/conll/devel.tsv": {"num_bytes": 577641, "checksum": "639fe423c00beeb33e83ef71e90af765c6d9cde61f52df0fbbb9d624302f5437"}, "https://github.com/spyysalo/bc2gm-corpus/raw/master/conll/test.tsv": {"num_bytes": 1165019, "checksum": "ac7745e40d97ffdf603aae661da37fa6065a7e2f9067ea1f47bfae3e5bf5d583"}}, "download_size": 4636753, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 9765744, "size_in_bytes": 14402497}}
