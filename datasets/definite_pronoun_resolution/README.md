### [Dataset Summary](#dataset-summary)

Composed by 30 students from one of the author's undergraduate classes. These
sentence pairs cover topics ranging from real events (e.g., Iran's plan to
attack the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.) to events/characters in movies (e.g.,
Batman) and purely imaginary situations, largely reflecting the pop culture as
perceived by the American kids born in the early 90s. Each annotated example
spans four lines: the first line contains the sentence, the second line contains
the target pronoun, the third line contains the two candidate antecedents, and
the fourth line contains the correct antecedent. If the target pronoun appears
more than once in the sentence, its first occurrence is the one to be resolved.

## [Dataset Structure](#dataset-structure)

We show detailed information for up to 5 configurations of the dataset.

### [Data Instances](#data-instances)

#### plain_text

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 0.22 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 0.23 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 0.45 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "candidates": ["coreference resolution", "chunking"],
    "label": 0,
    "pronoun": "it",
    "sentence": "There is currently more work on coreference resolution than on chunking because it is a problem that is still far from being solved."
}
```

### [Data Fields](#data-fields)

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### plain_text
- `sentence`: a `string` feature.
- `pronoun`: a `string` feature.
- `candidates`: a `list` of `string` features.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `0` (0), `1` (1).
