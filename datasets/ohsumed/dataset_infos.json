Using a commercial MEDLINE product based on the vector space model, these physicians searched just as effectively as more experienced searchers using Boolean searching. The results of this experiment were subsequently used to create a new large medical test collection, which was used in experiments with the SMART retrieval system to obtain baseline performance data as well as compare SMART with the other searchers.\",\nisbn=\"978-1-4471-2099-5\"\n}\n", "homepage": "http://davis.wpi.edu/xmdv/datasets/ohsumed.html", "license": "CC BY-NC 4.0", "features": {"seq_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "medline_ui": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "mesh_terms": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "title": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "publication_type": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "abstract": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "author": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "source": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "ohsumed", "config_name": "ohsumed", "version": {"version_str": "1.1.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 60382435, "num_examples": 54710, "dataset_name": "ohsumed"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 400637560, "num_examples": 348567, "dataset_name": "ohsumed"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://storage.googleapis.com/corona-tweet/ohsumed.zip": {"num_bytes": 156243249, "checksum": "28d01e98015f3753c4fd4642a1ff4fe2dc594a92a9a91cffd747dc2b86c8a96d"}}, "download_size": 156243249, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 461019995, "size_in_bytes": 617263244}}
