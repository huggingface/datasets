### Dataset Summary
The Hausa VOA NER is a named entity recognition (NER) dataset for Hausa language based on the [VOA Hausa news](https://www.voahausa.com/) corpus. 
### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[More Information Needed]

### Languages

The language supported is Hausa.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A data point consists of sentences seperated by empty line and tab-seperated tokens and tags. 
{'id': '0',
 'ner_tags': [B-PER, 0, 0, B-LOC, 0],
 'tokens': ['Trump', 'ya', 'ce', 'Rasha', 'ma']
}

### Data Fields

- `id`: id of the sample
- `tokens`: the tokens of the example text
- `ner_tags`: the NER tags of each token

The NER tags correspond to this list:
```
"O", "B-PER", "I-PER", "B-ORG", "I-ORG", "B-LOC", "I-LOC", "B-DATE", "I-DATE",
```
The NER tags have the same format as in the CoNLL shared task: a B denotes the first item of a phrase and an I any non-initial word. There are four types of phrases: person names (PER), organizations (ORG), locations (LOC) and dates & times (DATE). (O) is used for tokens not considered part of any named entity.

### Data Splits

Training (1,014 sentences), validation (145 sentences) and test split (291 sentences)

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The data was created to help introduce resources to new language - Hausa.

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The dataset is based on the news domain and was crawled from [VOA Hausa news](https://www.voahausa.com/).


[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

The dataset was collected from VOA Hausa news. Most of the texts used in creating the Hausa VOA NER are news stories from Nigeria, Niger Republic, United States, and other parts of the world.
