### Dataset Summary

The shared task of CoNLL-2003 concerns language-independent named entity recognition. We will concentrate on
four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do
not belong to the previous three groups.

The CoNLL-2003 shared task data files contain four columns separated by a single space. Each word has been put on
a separate line and there is an empty line after each sentence. The first item on each line is a word, the second
a part-of-speech (POS) tag, the third a syntactic chunk tag and the fourth the named entity tag. The chunk tags
and the named entity tags have the format I-TYPE which means that the word is inside a phrase of type TYPE. Only
if two phrases of the same type immediately follow each other, the first word of the second phrase will have tag
B-TYPE to show that it starts a new phrase. A word with tag O is not part of a phrase. Note the dataset uses IOB2
tagging scheme, whereas the original dataset uses IOB1.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### conll2003

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 4.63 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 9.78 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 14.41 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.

```
{
    "chunk_tags": [11, 12, 12, 21, 13, 11, 11, 21, 13, 11, 12, 13, 11, 21, 22, 11, 12, 17, 11, 21, 17, 11, 12, 12, 21, 22, 22, 13, 11, 0],
    "id": "0",
    "ner_tags": [0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    "pos_tags": [12, 22, 22, 38, 15, 22, 28, 38, 15, 16, 21, 35, 24, 35, 37, 16, 21, 15, 24, 41, 15, 16, 21, 21, 20, 37, 40, 35, 21, 7],
    "tokens": ["The", "European", "Commission", "said", "on", "Thursday", "it", "disagreed", "with", "German", "advice", "to", "consumers", "to", "shun", "British", "lamb", "until", "scientists", "determine", "whether", "mad", "cow", "disease", "can", "be", "transmitted", "to", "sheep", "."]
}
```

The original data files have `-DOCSTART-` lines used to separate documents, but these lines are removed here.
Indeed `-DOCSTART-` is a special line that acts as a boundary between two different documents, and it is filtered out in this implementation.

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.
