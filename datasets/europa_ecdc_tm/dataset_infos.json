This resource bears the name EAC Translation Memory, short EAC-TM.\nECDC-TM covers 25 languages: the 23 official languages of the EU plus Norwegian (Norsk) and Icelandic. ECDC-TM was created by translating from English into the following 24 languages: Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Gaelige (Irish), German, Greek, Finnish, French, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian (NOrsk), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.\nAll documents and sentences were thus originally written in English. They were then translated into the other languages by professional translators from the Translation Centre CdT in Luxembourg.", "citation": "@Article{Steinberger2014,\n        author={Steinberger, Ralf\n                and Ebrahim, Mohamed\n                and Poulis, Alexandros\n                and Carrasco-Benitez, Manuel\n                and Schl{\"u}ter, Patrick\n                and Przybyszewski, Marek\n                and Gilbro, Signe},\n        title={An overview of the European Union's highly multilingual parallel corpora},\n        journal={Language Resources and Evaluation},\n        year={2014},\n        month={Dec},\n        day={01},\n        volume={48},\n        number={4},\n        pages={679-707},\n        issn={1574-0218},\n        doi={10.1007/s10579-014-9277-0},\n        url={https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-014-9277-0}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies/ecdc-translation-memory", "license": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International(CC BY 4.0) licence Copyright \u00a9 EU/ECDC, 1995-2020", "features": {"translation": {"languages": ["en", "sv"], "id": null, "_type": "Translation"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": {"input": "en", "output": "sv"}, "builder_name": "europa_ecdc_tm", "config_name": "en2sv", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": "", "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 546349, "num_examples": 2527, "dataset_name": "europa_ecdc_tm"}}, "download_checksums": {"http://optima.jrc.it/Resources/ECDC-TM/ECDC-TM.zip": {"num_bytes": 4286636, "checksum": "cfd2dec349e4e5c9faab56596b708f4808a614733f6f763f49b2d6f74c9e86d8"}}, "download_size": 4286636, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 546349, "size_in_bytes": 4832985}}
