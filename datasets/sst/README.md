### Dataset Summary

The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is the first corpus with fully labeled parse trees that allows for a complete analysis of the compositional effects of sentiment in language.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `sentiment-scoring`: Each complete sentence is annotated with a `float` label that indicates its level of positive sentiment from 0.0 to 1.0. One can decide to use only complete sentences or to include the contributions of the sub-sentences (aka phrases). The labels for each phrase are included in the `dictionary` configuration. To obtain all the phrases in a sentence we need to visit the parse tree included with each example. In contrast, the `ptb` configuration explicitly provides all the labelled parse trees in Penn Treebank format. Here the labels are binned in 5 bins from 0 to 4.
- `sentiment-classification`: We can transform the above into a binary sentiment classification task by rounding each label to 0 or 1.

### Languages

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

For the `default` configuration:
```
{'label': 0.7222200036048889,
 'sentence': 'Yet the act is still charming here .',
 'tokens': 'Yet|the|act|is|still|charming|here|.',
 'tree': '15|13|13|10|9|9|11|12|10|11|12|14|14|15|0'}
```

For the `dictionary` configuration:
```
{'label': 0.7361099720001221, 
'phrase': 'still charming'}
```

For the `ptb` configuration:
```
{'ptb_tree': '(3 (2 Yet) (3 (2 (2 the) (2 act)) (3 (4 (3 (2 is) (3 (2 still) (4 charming))) (2 here)) (2 .))))'}
```

### Data Fields

- `sentence`: a complete sentence expressing an opinion about a film
- `label`: the degree of "positivity" of the opinion, on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0
- `tokens`: a sequence of tokens that form a sentence
- `tree`: a sentence parse tree formatted as a parent pointer tree
- `phrase`: a sub-sentence of a complete sentence
- `ptb_tree`: a sentence parse tree formatted in Penn Treebank-style, where each component's degree of positive sentiment is labelled on a scale from 0 to 4

### Data Splits

The set of complete sentences (both `default` and `ptb` configurations) is split into a training, validation and test set. The `dictionary` configuration has only one split as it is used for reference rather than for learning.
