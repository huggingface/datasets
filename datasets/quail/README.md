An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "answers": ["the cousin is not friendly", "the cousin could have been pretier", "not enough information", "the cousin was too nice"],
    "context": "\"That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm...",
