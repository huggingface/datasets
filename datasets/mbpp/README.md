## Dataset Description
- **Repository:** https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp
- **Paper:** [Program Synthesis with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732)

### Dataset Summary
The benchmark consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering programming fundamentals, standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a task description, code solution and 3 automated test cases. As described in the paper, a subset of the data has been hand-verified by us. 

Released [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp) as part of [Program Synthesis with Large Language Models, Austin et. al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732).

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
This dataset is used to evaluate code generations.

### Languages
English - Python code

## Dataset Structure

```python
dataset_full = load_dataset("mbpp")
DatasetDict({
    test: Dataset({
        features: ['task_id', 'text', 'code', 'test_list', 'test_setup_code', 'challenge_test_list'],
        num_rows: 974
    })
})

dataset_sanitized = load_dataset("mbpp", "sanitized")
DatasetDict({
    test: Dataset({
        features: ['source_file', 'task_id', 'prompt', 'code', 'test_imports', 'test_list'],
        num_rows: 427
    })
})
```

        ]
}
```
### Data Fields

- `source_file`: unknown
- `text`/`prompt`: description of programming task
- `code`: solution for programming task
- `test_setup_code`/`test_imports`: necessary code imports to execute tests
- `test_list`: list of tests to verify solution
- `challenge_test_list`: list of more challenging test to further probe solution

### Data Splits
There are two version of the dataset (full and sanitized) which only one split each (test).
## Dataset Creation
See section 2.1 of original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07732).

### Curation Rationale
In order to evaluate code generation functions a set of simple programming tasks as well as solutions is necessary which this dataset provides.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization
The dataset was manually created from scratch.

#### Who are the source language producers?
The dataset was created with an internal crowdsourcing effort at Google.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process
The full dataset was created first and a subset then underwent a second round to improve the task descriptions.

#### Who are the annotators?
The dataset was created with an internal crowdsourcing effort at Google.

### Personal and Sensitive Information
None.

## Considerations for Using the Data
Make sure you execute generated Python code in a safe environment when evauating against this dataset as generated code could be harmful.

### Social Impact of Dataset
With this dataset code generating models can be better evaluated which leads to fewer issues introduced when using such models.

### Discussion of Biases

### Other Known Limitations
Since the task descriptions might not be expressive enough to solve the task. The `sanitized` split aims at addressing this issue by having a second round of annotators improve the dataset.
