### Dataset Summary

This corpus contains preprocessed posts from the Reddit dataset (Webis-TLDR-17).
The dataset consists of 3,848,330 posts with an average length of 270 words for content,
and 28 words for the summary.

Features includes strings: author, body, normalizedBody, content, summary, subreddit, subreddit_id.
Content is used as document and summary is used as summary.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 2996.31 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 18063.11 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 21059.41 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "author": "me",
    "body": "<>",
    "content": "input document.",
    "id": "1",
    "normalizedBody": "",
    "subreddit": "machinelearning",
    "subreddit_id": "2",
    "summary": "output summary."
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `author`: a `string` feature.
- `body`: a `string` feature.
- `normalizedBody`: a `string` feature.
- `subreddit`: a `string` feature.
- `subreddit_id`: a `string` feature.
- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `content`: a `string` feature.
- `summary`: a `string` feature.

### Data Splits

| name  | train |
|-------|------:|
|default|3848330|

This corpus does not contain a separate test set. Thus it is up to the users to divide the corpus into appropriate training, validation and test sets.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

In the scope of the task of absractive summarization the creators of the Webis-TLDR-17 propose mining social media for author-provided summaries and taking advantage of the common practice of appending a "TL;DR" to long posts. A large Reddit crawl was used to yield the Webis-TLDR-17 corpus. This dataset intends to complement the existing summarization corpora primarily from the news genre.

### Source Data

Reddit subreddits posts (submissions & comments) containing "TL;DR" from 2006 to 2016. Multiple subreddits are included.

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Initial data: a set of 286 million submissions and 1.6 billion comments posted to Reddit between 2006 and 2016.
Then a five-step pipeline of consecutive filtering steps was applied.

#### Who are the source language producers?

The contents of the dataset are produced by human authors, bot-generated content was eliminated by filtering out all bot accounts with the help of an extensive list provided by the Reddit community, as well as manual inspection of cases where the user name contained the substring "bot."

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

This dataset has been created to serve as a source of large-scale summarization training data. It is primarily geared towards the automatic abstractive summarization task, that can be considered one of the most challenging variants of automatic summarization. It also aims to tackle the lack of genre diversity in the summarization datasets (most are news-related).

### Other Known Limitations

Reddit users write TL;DRs with various intentions, such as providing a “true” summary, asking questions or for help, or forming judgments and conclusions. As noted in the paper introducing the dataset, although the first kind of TL;DR posts are most important for training summarization models, yet, the latter allow for various alternative summarization-related tasks.

Although filtering was performed abusive language maybe still be present.
