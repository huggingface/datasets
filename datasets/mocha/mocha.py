_DESCRIPTION = """\
Posing reading comprehension as a generation problem provides a great deal of flexibility, allowing for \
open-ended questions with few restrictions on possible answers. However, progress is impeded by existing \
generation metrics, which rely on token overlap and are agnostic to the nuances of reading comprehension. \
To address this, we introduce a benchmark for training and evaluating generative reading comprehension metrics: \
MOdeling Correctness with Human Annotations. MOCHA contains 40K human judgement scores on model outputs from \
6 diverse question answering datasets and an additional set of minimal pairs for evaluation. Using MOCHA, \
we train an evaluation metric: LERC, a Learned Evaluation metric for Reading Comprehension, to mimic human \
judgement scores.
