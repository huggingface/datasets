### Dataset Summary

CORD-19 is a corpus of academic papers about COVID-19 and related coronavirus research.  It's curated and maintained by the Semantic Scholar team at the Allen Institute for AI to support text mining and NLP research.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

See tasks defined in the related [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks)

### Languages

The dataset is in english (en).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

TODO

### Data Fields

Currently only the following fields are integrated: `cord_uid`, `sha`, `title`, `abstract`

- `cord_uid`:  A `str`-valued field that assigns a unique identifier to each CORD-19 paper.  This is not necessariy unique per row, which is explained in the FAQs.
- `sha`:  A `List[str]`-valued field that is the SHA1 of all PDFs associated with the CORD-19 paper.  Most papers will have either zero or one value here (since we either have a PDF or we don't), but some papers will have multiple.  For example, the main paper might have supplemental information saved in a separate PDF.  Or we might have two separate PDF copies of the same paper.  If multiple PDFs exist, their SHA1 will be semicolon-separated (e.g. `'4eb6e165ee705e2ae2a24ed2d4e67da42831ff4a; d4f0247db5e916c20eae3f6d772e8572eb828236'`)
- `source_x`:  A `List[str]`-valued field that is the names of sources from which we received this paper.  Also semicolon-separated.  For example, `'ArXiv; Elsevier; PMC; WHO'`.  There should always be at least one source listed.
- `title`:  A `str`-valued field for the paper title
- `doi`: A `str`-valued field for the paper DOI
- `pmcid`: A `str`-valued field for the paper's ID on PubMed Central.  Should begin with `PMC` followed by an integer.
- `pubmed_id`: An `int`-valued field for the paper's ID on PubMed.  
- `license`: A `str`-valued field with the most permissive license we've found associated with this paper.  Possible values include:  `'cc0', 'hybrid-oa', 'els-covid', 'no-cc', 'cc-by-nc-sa', 'cc-by', 'gold-oa', 'biorxiv', 'green-oa', 'bronze-oa', 'cc-by-nc', 'medrxiv', 'cc-by-nd', 'arxiv', 'unk', 'cc-by-sa', 'cc-by-nc-nd'`
- `abstract`: A `str`-valued field for the paper's abstract
- `publish_time`:  A `str`-valued field for the published date of the paper.  This is in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.  Not always accurate as some publishers will denote unknown dates with future dates like `yyyy-12-31`
- `authors`:  A `List[str]`-valued field for the authors of the paper.  Each author name is in `Last, First Middle` format and semicolon-separated.
- `journal`:  A `str`-valued field for the paper journal.  Strings are not normalized (e.g. `BMJ` and `British Medical Journal` can both exist). Empty string if unknown.
- `mag_id`:  Deprecated, but originally an `int`-valued field for the paper as represented in the Microsoft Academic Graph.
- `who_covidence_id`:  A `str`-valued field for the ID assigned by the WHO for this paper.  Format looks like `#72306`. 
- `arxiv_id`:  A `str`-valued field for the arXiv ID of this paper.
- `pdf_json_files`:  A `List[str]`-valued field containing paths from the root of the current data dump version to the parses of the paper PDFs into JSON format.  Multiple paths are semicolon-separated.  Example: `document_parses/pdf_json/4eb6e165ee705e2ae2a24ed2d4e67da42831ff4a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d4f0247db5e916c20eae3f6d772e8572eb828236.json`
- `pmc_json_files`:  A `List[str]`-valued field.  Same as above, but corresponding to the full text XML files downloaded from PMC, parsed into the same JSON format as above.
- `url`: A `List[str]`-valued field containing all URLs associated with this paper.  Semicolon-separated.
- `s2_id`:  A `str`-valued field containing the Semantic Scholar ID for this paper.  Can be used with the Semantic Scholar API (e.g. `s2_id=9445722` corresponds to `http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpusid:9445722`)
