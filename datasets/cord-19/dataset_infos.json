{"cord-19": {"description": "The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) is a growing resource of scientific papers on Covid-19 and related\nhistorical coronavirus research. CORD-19 is designed to facilitate the development of text mining and information\nretrieval systems over its rich collection of metadata and structured full text papers. Since its release, CORD-19\nhas been downloaded over 75K times and has served as the basis of many Covid-19 text mining and discovery systems.\n\nThe dataset itself isn't defining a specific task, but there is a Kaggle challenge that define 17 open research\nquestions to be solved with the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks\n", "citation": "@article{Wang2020CORD19TC,\n  title={CORD-19: The Covid-19 Open Research Dataset},\n  author={Lucy Lu Wang and Kyle Lo and Yoganand Chandrasekhar and Russell Reas and Jiangjiang Yang and Darrin Eide and\n  K.
