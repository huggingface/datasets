The fact checking is done by [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/), [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/), and [The Weekly Standard](https://www.weeklystandard.com/).

- [FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/) self describes as "a nonpartisan, nonprofit 'consumer advocate' for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics." It was founded by journalists Kathleen Hall Jamieson and Brooks Jackson and is currently directed by Eugene Kiely.
- [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/) describe their ethics as "seeking to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases, [with] journalists setting their own opinions aside." It was started in August 2007 by Times Washington Bureau Chief Bill Adair. The organization was acquired in February 2018 by the Poynter Institute, a non-profit journalism education and news media research center that also owns the Tampa Bay Times.
- [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) is a newspaper considered to be near the center of the American political spectrum. In 2013 Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos bought the newspaper and affiliated publications.

The original data source also contains 132 items reviewed by [The Weekly Standard](https://www.weeklystandard.com/), which was a neo-conservative American newspaper. IT is the most politically loaded source of the group, which was originally a vocal creitic of the activity of fact-checking, and has historically taken stances [close to the American right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weekly_Standard#Support_of_the_invasion_of_Iraq). It also had to admit responsibility for baseless accusations against a well known author in a public [libel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weekly_Standard#Libel_case). The fact checked items from this source can be found in the `weekly_standard` configuration but should be used only with full understanding of this context.
