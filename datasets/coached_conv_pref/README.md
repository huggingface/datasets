### Dataset Summary

A dataset consisting of 502 English dialogs with 12,000 annotated utterances between a user and an assistant discussing movie preferences in natural language. It was collected using a Wizard-of-Oz  methodology between two paid crowd-workers, where one worker plays the role of an 'assistant', while the other plays the role of a 'user'. The 'assistant' elicits the 'userâ€™s' preferences about movies following a Coached Conversational Preference Elicitation (CCPE) method. The assistant asks questions designed to minimize the bias in the terminology the 'user' employs to convey his or her preferences as much as possible, and to obtain these preferences in natural language. Each dialog is annotated with entity mentions, preferences expressed about entities, descriptions of entities provided, and other statements of entities.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

* `other-other-Conversational Recommendation`:  The dataset can be used to train a model for Conversational recommendation, which consists in Coached Conversation Preference Elicitation. 

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in English. The associated BCP-47 code is `en`.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises of a series of utterances between the 'assistant' and the 'user'. Each such utterance is annotated into categories mentioned in data fields.

An example from the Coached Conversational Preference Elicitation dataset looks as follows:

```



### Data Fields

Each conversation has the following fields:

* `conversationId`: A unique random ID for the conversation. The ID has no meaning.
* `utterances`: An array of utterances by the workers.

Each utterance has the following fields:

* `index`: A 0-based index indicating the order of the utterances in the conversation.
* `speaker`: Either USER or ASSISTANT, indicating which role generated this utterance.
* `text`: The raw text as written by the ASSISTANT, or transcribed from the spoken recording of USER.
* `segments`: An array of semantic annotations of spans in the text.  

Each semantic annotation segment has the following fields:

* `startIndex`: The position of the start of the annotation in the utterance text.
* `endIndex`: The position of the end of the annotation in the utterance text.
* `text`: The raw text that has been annotated.
* `annotations`: An array of annotation details for this segment.

Each annotation has two fields:

* `annotationType`: The class of annotation (see ontology below).
* `entityType`: The class of the entity to which the text refers (see ontology below).

**EXPLANATION OF ONTOLOGY**

In the corpus, preferences and the entities that these preferences refer to are annotated with an annotation type as well as an entity type.

Annotation types fall into four categories:

* `ENTITY_NAME` (0): These mark the names of relevant entities mentioned.
* `ENTITY_PREFERENCE` (1): These are defined as statements indicating that the dialog participant does or does not like the relevant entity in general, or that they do or do not like some aspect of the entity. This may also be thought of the participant having some sentiment about what is being discussed.
* `ENTITY_DESCRIPTION` (2): Neutral descriptions that describe an entity but do not convey an explicit liking or disliking.
* `ENTITY_OTHER` (3): Other relevant statements about an entity that convey relevant information of how the participant relates to the entity but do not provide a sentiment. Most often, these relate to whether a participant has seen a particular movie, or knows a lot about a given entity.

Entity types are marked as belonging to one of four categories:

* `MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY` (0): For genres or general descriptions that capture a particular type or style of movie.
* `MOVIE_OR_SERIES` (1): For the full or partial name of a movie or series of movies.
* `PERSON` (2): For the full or partial name of an actual person.
* `SOMETHING_ELSE ` (3):  For other important proper nouns, such as the names of characters or locations.

### Data Splits

There is a single split of the dataset named 'train' which contains the whole datset.
