### Dataset Summary

The Setswana Ner Corpus is a Setswana dataset developed by [The Centre for Text Technology (CTexT), North-West University, South Africa](http://humanities.nwu.ac.za/ctext). The data is based on documents from the South African goverment domain and crawled from gov.za websites. It was created to support NER task for Setswana language. The dataset uses CoNLL shared task annotation standards.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[More Information Needed]

### Languages

The language supported is Setswana.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A data point consists of sentences seperated by empty line and tab-seperated tokens and tags.
```
{'id': '0',
 'ner_tags': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 'tokens': ['Ka', 'dinako', 'dingwe', ',', 'go']
}
```
### Data Fields

- `id`: id of the sample
- `tokens`: the tokens of the example text
- `ner_tags`: the NER tags of each token

The NER tags correspond to this list:
```
"OUT", "B-PERS", "I-PERS", "B-ORG", "I-ORG", "B-LOC", "I-LOC", "B-MISC", "I-MISC",
```
The NER tags have the same format as in the CoNLL shared task: a B denotes the first item of a phrase and an I any non-initial word. There are four types of phrases: person names (PER), organizations (ORG), locations (LOC) and miscellaneous names (MISC). (OUT) is used for tokens not considered part of any named entity.

### Data Splits

The data was not split.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The data was created to help introduce resources to new language - setswana.
