Each sentence was annotated following the\nFLORES setup, which presents a form of DA, where at least three professional\ntranslators rate each sentence from 0-100 according to the perceived translation\nquality. DA scores are standardised using the z-score by rater. Participating systems\nare required to score sentences according to z-standardised DA scores.\n", "citation": "\nNot available.\n", "homepage": "http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/quality-estimation-task.html", "license": "Unknown", "features": {"segid": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "translation": {"languages": ["ru", "en"], "id": null, "_type": "Translation"}, "scores": {"feature": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "mean": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "z_scores": {"feature": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "z_mean": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "model_score": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "doc_id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "nmt_output": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "word_probas": {"feature": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "wmt20_mlqe_task1", "config_name": "ru-en", "version": {"version_str": "1.1.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 3520776, "num_examples": 7000, "dataset_name": "wmt20_mlqe_task1"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 478787, "num_examples": 1000, "dataset_name": "wmt20_mlqe_task1"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 499601, "num_examples": 1000, "dataset_name": "wmt20_mlqe_task1"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/wmt20_files_qe/ru-en.tar.gz": {"num_bytes": 1897111, "checksum": "a1b762e4c21195b3c8e65e65ab5fb75527d4f8d3ce54e34de18ef773d22f675f"}, "https://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/wmt20_files_qe/ru-en_test.tar.gz": {"num_bytes": 226573, "checksum": "9c1d35a2b3f5d807f5fa54ae9114ba8384dcd2929452435b54306efe1d501956"}}, "download_size": 2123684, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 4499164, "size_in_bytes": 6622848}}
