The distribution of labels in the LIAR dataset is relatively well-balanced: except for 1,050 pants-fire cases, the instances for all other labels range from 2,063 to 2,638.

However, statistical approaches to combating fake news has been dramatically limited by the lack of labeled benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present LIAR: a new, publicly available dataset for fake news detection. We collected a decade-long, 12.8K manually labeled short statements in various contexts from PolitiFact.com, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source documents for each case. This dataset can be used for fact-checking research as well. Notably, this new dataset is an order of magnitude larger than previously largest public fake news datasets of similar type. Empirically, we investigate automatic fake news detection based on surface-level linguistic patterns. We have designed a novel, hybrid convolutional neural network to integrate meta-data with text. We show that this hybrid approach can improve a text-only deep learning model.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-2067", "license": "Unknown", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "label": {"num_classes": 6, "names": ["false", "half-true", "mostly-true", "true", "barely-true", "pants-fire"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "statement": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "subject": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "speaker": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "job_title": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "state_info": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "party_affiliation": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "barely_true_counts": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "false_counts": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "half_true_counts": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "mostly_true_counts": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "pants_on_fire_counts": {"dtype": "float32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "context": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": {"input": "statement", "output": "label"}, "builder_name": "liar", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 2730651, "num_examples": 10269, "dataset_name": "liar"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 341414, "num_examples": 1283, "dataset_name": "liar"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 341592, "num_examples": 1284, "dataset_name": "liar"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip": {"num_bytes": 1013571, "checksum": "611c1addad919743dde15822b87a60bfb760d8f85597f25289e34621800654c7"}}, "download_size": 1013571, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 3413657, "size_in_bytes": 4427228}}
