### Dataset Summary

ConceptNet is a multilingual knowledge base, representing words and
phrases that people use and the common-sense relationships between
them. The knowledge in ConceptNet is collected from a variety of
resources, including crowd-sourced resources (such as Wiktionary and
Open Mind Common Sense), games with a purpose (such as Verbosity and
nadya.jp), and expert-created resources (such as WordNet and JMDict).

You can browse what ConceptNet knows at http://conceptnet.io.

This dataset is designed to provide training data
for common sense relationships pulls together from various sources.

The dataset is multi-lingual. See langauge codes and language info
here: https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Languages


This dataset provides an interface for the conceptnet5 csv file, and
some (but not all) of the raw text data used to build conceptnet5:
omcsnet_sentences_free.txt, and omcsnet_sentences_more.txt.

One use of this dataset would be to learn to extract the conceptnet
relationship from the omcsnet sentences.

Conceptnet5 has 34,074,917 relationships. Of those relationships,
there are 2,176,099 surface text sentences related to those 2M
entries.

omcsnet_sentences_free has 898,161 lines. omcsnet_sentences_more has
2,001,736 lines.

Original downloads are available here
https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Downloads. For more
information, see: https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki

The omcsnet data comes with the following warning from the authors of
the above site: 

Remember: this data comes from various forms of
crowdsourcing. Sentences in these files are not necessarily true,
useful, or appropriate.

### Languages
en, fr, it, de, es, ru, pt, ja, nl, zh and others

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

There are three configurations for the dataset: conceptnet5, omcs_sentences_free, omcs_sentences_more. 

Conceptnet5 defines:

``
{
	'sentence': ...,
	'full_rel': ...,
	'rel': ...,
	'arg1': ...,
	'arg2': ...,
	'lang': ...,
	'extra_info': ...
	'weight': ...
}
``

The omcs text defines:
``
{
	'sentence': ...,
	'raw_data': ...
	'weight': ...
}
``

### Data Fields

For conceptnet5 configurations:
* full_rel: the full relationship. e.g., /a/[/r/Antonym/,/c/en/able/,/c/en/cane/] 
* rel: the binary relationship. e.g., /r/Antonym      
* arg1: the first argument to the binary relationship. e.g., /c/en/able
* arg2: the second argument to the binary relationship. e.g., /c/en/cane      
* lang: the language code. e.g., en, fr, etc. If the arg1 and arg2 are two different languages, then the form os lang1/lang2.
* extra_info: a string that includes json data that has the dataset name, license type (mostly cc-4.0), contributor, etc. e.g., : {"dataset": "/d/verbosity", "license": "cc:by/4.0", "sources": [{"contributor": "/s/resource/verbosity"}], "surfaceEnd": "cane", "surfaceStart": "able", "surfaceText": "[[able]] is the opposite of [[cane]]", "weight": 0.299}
* sentence: the sentence from which the relationship was extracted, if one exists, with brackets around the arg1 and arg2. e.g., [[able]] is the opposite of [[cane]]
* weight: the weight assigned by the curators or automatically to the relationship, between 1.0-0.0, higher being more certain. 

For the omcs text configurations:

* sentence: the raw sentence
* raw_data: the raw tab seperated data of the form, id, text, curator_id, created_on, lanugage_id, activity_id, and score. Most of this information was tied to older systems for entering the data os was not partsed into fields for the dataset. e.g., 1237278 someone can be at catch 10805   2006-11-14 17:56:49.70872-05    en 27      1
* lang: the language code

### Data Splits

There are no splits. 

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was gathered and created over many years for research in common sense reasoning. 

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Started as the Open Mind Common Sense project at MIT Media Lab in 1999. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Mind_Common_Sense

#### Who are the source language producers?

Crowd Sourced

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Crowd Source template text, games, etc. 

#### Who are the annotators?

Crowd sourced.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

Unkown, but likely there are names of famous individuals.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The goal for the work is to help machines understand common sense.

### Discussion of Biases

See the website and paper for efforts to minimize data bias, but
please note that omcs_sentences_free, omcs_sentences_more are raw data
entered by users and may very well have biased data.


### Other Known Limitations

While the relationship dataset is large, the amount of actual sentences is limited.

## Additional Information

### Dataset Curators

Commonsense Computing
The Commonsense Computing project originated at the MIT Media Lab and expanded worldwide. Tens of thousands of contributors have taken some time to teach facts to computers. Their pseudonyms can be found in the "sources" list found in ConceptNet's raw data and in its API.

Games with a Purpose
Data collected from Verbosity, one of the CMU "Games with a Purpose", is used and released under ConceptNet's license, by permission from Luis von Ahn and Harshit Surana.

Verbosity players are anonymous, so in the "sources" list, data from Verbosity is simply credited to the pseudonym "verbosity".

Wikimedia projects
ConceptNet uses data directly from Wiktionary, the free dictionary. It also uses data from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia via DBPedia.

Wiktionary and Wikipedia are collaborative projects, authored by their respective online communities. They are currently released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.

Wikimedia encourages giving attribution by providing links to the hosted pages that the data came from, and DBPedia asks for the same thing in turn. In addition to crediting the assertions that came from Wiktionary and DBPedia, we also provide "ExternalURL" edges pointing to the page that they came from. For example, the term /c/de/sprache has an ExternalURL link pointing to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sprache. Its list of individual contributors can be seen by following its "History" link.

The URLs of links to DBPedia are the same as the resource names that DBPedia uses, encouraging interoperability with their linked data.
