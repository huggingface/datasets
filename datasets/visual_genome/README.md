### Dataset Summary

Visual Genome is a dataset, a knowledge base, an ongoing effort to connect structured image concepts to language.

From the paper:
> Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as
image classification, computers still perform poorly on
cognitive tasks such as image description and question
answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not
just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world.
However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the
same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve
success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand
the interactions and relationships between objects in an
image. When asked “What vehicle is the person riding?”,
computers will need to identify the objects in an image
as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and
pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that “the
person is riding a horse-drawn carriage.”

Visual Genome has:
 - 108,077 image
 - 5.4 Million Region Descriptions
 - 1.7 Million Visual Question Answers
 - 3.8 Million Object Instances
 - 2.8 Million Attributes
 - 2.3 Million Relationships

From the paper:
> Our dataset contains over 108K images where each
image has an average of 35 objects, 26 attributes, and 21
pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize
the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases
in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to
WordNet synsets.

### Dataset Preprocessing

### Data Fields

When loading a specific configuration, users has to append a version dependent suffix:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
load_dataset("visual_genome", "region_description_v1.2.0")
```

#### region_descriptions

- `image`: A `PIL.Image.Image` object containing the image. Note that when accessing the image column: `dataset[0]["image"]` the image file is automatically decoded. Decoding of a large number of image files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"image"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["image"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["image"][0]`
- `image_id`: Unique numeric ID of the image.
- `url`:  URL of source image.
- `width`: Image width.
- `height`: Image height.
- `coco_id`: Id mapping to MSCOCO indexing.

From the paper:
> We used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) as our primary source of annotations. Overall, a total of over
33, 000 unique workers contributed to the dataset. The
dataset was collected over the course of 6 months after
15 months of experimentation and iteration on the data
representation. Approximately 800, 000 Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) were launched on AMT, where
each HIT involved creating descriptions, questions and
answers, or region graphs. Each HIT was designed such
that workers manage to earn anywhere between $6-$8
per hour if they work continuously, in line with ethical
research standards on Mechanical Turk (Salehi et al.,
2015). Visual Genome HITs achieved a 94.1% retention
rate, meaning that 94.1% of workers who completed one
of our tasks went ahead to do more. [...] 93.02% of workers contributed from the United States.
The majority of our workers were
between the ages of 25 and 34 years old. Our youngest
contributor was 18 years and the oldest was 68 years
old. We also had a near-balanced split of 54.15% male
and 45.85% female workers.
