### Dataset Summary

The Sequence labellIng evaLuatIon benChmark fOr spoken laNguagE (SILICONE) benchmark is a collection of resources for training, evaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems specifically designed for spoken language. All datasets are in the English language and covers a variety of domains including daily life, scripted scenarios, joint task completion, phone call conversations, and televsion dialogue. Some datasets additionally include emotion and/or sentimant labels.

In this work, we propose a new approach to learn generic representations adapted to spoken dialog, which we evaluate on a new benchmark we call Sequence labellIng evaLuatIon benChmark fOr spoken laNguagE benchmark (SILICONE). SILICONE is model-agnostic and contains 10 different datasets of various sizes. We obtain our representations with a hierarchical encoder based on transformer architectures, for which we extend two well-known pre-training objectives. Pre-training is performed on OpenSubtitles: a large corpus of spoken dialog containing over 2.3 billion of tokens. We demonstrate how hierarchical encoders achieve competitive results with consistently fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art models and we show their importance for both pre-training and fine-tuning.",
