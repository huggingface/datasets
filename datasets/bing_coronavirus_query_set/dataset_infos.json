Only searches that were issued many times by multiple users were included. The dataset includes queries from all over the world that had an intent related to the Coronavirus or Covid-19. In some cases this intent is explicit in the query itself (e.g., \u201cCoronavirus updates Seattle\u201d), in other cases it is implicit , e.g. \u201cShelter in place\u201d. The implicit intent of search queries (e.g., \u201cToilet paper\u201d) was extracted using random walks on the click graph as outlined in this paper by Microsoft Research. All personal data were removed.\n", "citation": "", "homepage": "https://github.com/microsoft/BingCoronavirusQuerySet", "license": "", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "Date": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "Query": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "IsImplicitIntent": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "Country": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "PopularityScore": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "bing_coronavirus_query_set", "config_name": "country_2020-09-01_2020-09-30", "version": "0.0.0", "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 22052706, "num_examples": 317856, "dataset_name": "bing_coronavirus_query_set"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/BingCoronavirusQuerySet/master/data/2020/QueriesByCountry_2020-09-01_2020-09-30.tsv": {"num_bytes": 16351450, "checksum": "ff0eac0790cd4a276cb83c74200d692b0b38b6dc36cfc93b513415aed3dc724b"}}, "download_size": 16351450, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 22052706, "size_in_bytes": 38404156}}
