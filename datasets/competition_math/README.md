### Dataset Summary

The Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) dataset consists of problems
from mathematics competitions, including the AMC 10, AMC 12, AIME, and more. 
Each problem in MATH has a full step-by-step solution, which can be used to teach
models to generate answer derivations and explanations.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A data instance consists of a competition math problem and its step-by-step solution written in LaTeX and natural language. The step-by-step solution contains the final answer enclosed in LaTeX's `\boxed` tag.

An example from the dataset is:
```
{'problem': 'A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.',
 'level': 'Level 1',
 'type': 'Counting & Probability',
 'solution': 'The spinner is guaranteed to land on exactly one of the three regions, so we know that the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region will be 1. If we let the probability of it landing in region $C$ be $x$, we then have the equation $1 = \\frac{5}{12}+\\frac{1}{3}+x$, from which we have $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.'}
```

### Data Fields

* `problem`: The competition math problem.
* `solution`: The step-by-step solution.
* `level`: The problem's difficulty level from 'Level 1' to 'Level 5', where a subject's easiest problems for humans are assigned to 'Level 1' and a subject's hardest problems are assigned to 'Level 5'.
* `type`: The subject of the problem: Algebra, Counting & Probability, Geometry, Intermediate Algebra, Number Theory, Prealgebra and Precalculus.

### Data Splits

* train: 7,500 examples
* test: 5,000 examples
