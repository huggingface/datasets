### Dataset Summary

OneStopQA is a multiple choice reading comprehension dataset annotated according to the STARC (Structured Annotations for Reading Comprehension) scheme. The reading materials are Guardian articles taken from the [OneStopEnglish corpus](https://github.com/nishkalavallabhi/OneStopEnglishCorpus). Each article comes in three difficulty levels, Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced. Each paragraph is annotated with three multiple choice reading comprehension questions. The reading comprehension questions can be answered based on any of the three paragraph levels.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[Needs More Information]

### Languages

English (`en-US`).

The original Guardian articles were manually converted from British to American English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example of instance looks as follows.

```json
{
  "title": "101-Year-Old Bottle Message",
  "paragraph": "Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather. He died in 1946, six years before she was born. But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea. Thought to be the worldâ€™s oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany.",
  "paragraph_index": 1,
  "level": "Adv",
  "question": "How did Angela Erdmann find out about the bottle?", 
  "answers": ["A museum told her that they had it", 
              "She coincidentally saw it at the museum where it was held", 
              "She found it in her basement on April 28th, 2014", 
              "A friend told her about it"],
  "a_span": [56, 70], 
  "d_span": [16, 34]
}
```
Where, 

| Answer | Description                                                | Textual Span    |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| a      | Correct answer.                                            | Critical Span   |
| b      | Incorrect answer. A miscomprehension of the critical span. | Critical Span   |
| c      | Incorrect answer. Refers to an additional span.            | Distractor Span |
| d      | Incorrect answer. Has no textual support.                  | -               |

The order of the answers in the `answers` list corresponds to the order of the answers in the table.

### Data Fields

- `title`: A `string` feature. The article title.
- `paragraph`: A `string` feature. The paragraph from the article. 
- `paragraph_index`: An `int` feature. Corresponds to the paragraph index in the article.
- `question`: A `string` feature. The given question.
- `answers`: A list of `string` feature containing the four possible answers.
- `a_span`: A list of start and end indices (inclusive) of the critical span.
- `d_span`: A list of start and end indices (inclusive) of the distractor span.

*Span indices are according to word positions after whitespace tokenization. 

**In the rare case where a span is spread over multiple sections, 
the span list will contain multiple instances of start and stop indices in the format:
  [start_1, stop_1, start_2, stop_2,...].
