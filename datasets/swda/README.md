### Dataset Summary

The Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SwDA) extends the Switchboard-1 Telephone Speech Corpus, Release 2 with 
turn/utterance-level dialog-act tags. The tags summarize syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information about the 
associated turn. The SwDA project was undertaken at UC Boulder in the late 1990s.
The SwDA is not inherently linked to the Penn Treebank 3 parses of Switchboard, and it is far from straightforward to 
align the two resources. In addition, the SwDA is not distributed with the Switchboard's tables of metadata about the 
conversations and their participants.

### Languages

The language supported is English.

## Dataset Structure

Utterance are tagged with the [SWBD-DAMSL](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97/manual.august1.html) DA.

### Data Instances


An example from the dataset is:

`{'act_tag': 125, 'caller': 'A', 'conversation_no': 3774, 'damsl_act_tag': 4, 'pos': "So/UH I/PRP 've/VBP been/VBN concerned/JJ about/IN crime/NN lately/RB ./.", 'ptb_basename': '3/sw3774', 'ptb_treenumbers': '', 'swda_filename': 'sw10utt/sw_1029_3774.utt', 'text': "{C So } I've been concerned about crime lately. /", 'transcript_index': 0, 'trees': '', 'utterance_index': 1}`


### Data Fields

'swda_filename':       (str) The filename: directory/basename

'ptb_basename':        (str) The Treebank filename: add ".pos" for POS and ".mrg" for trees

'conversation_no':     (int) The conversation Id, to key into the metadata database.

'transcript_index':    (int) The line number of this item in the transcript (counting only utt lines).

'act_tag':             (list of str) The Dialog Act Tags (separated by ||| in the file).

'caller':              (str) A, B, @A, @B, @@A, @@B

'utterance_index':     (int) The encoded index of the utterance (the number in A.49, B.27, etc.)

'subutterance_index':  (int) Utterances can be broken across line. This gives the internal position.

'text':                (str) The text of the utterance

'pos':                 (str) The POS tagged version of the utterance, from PtbBasename+.pos

'trees':               (list of nltk.tree.Tree) The tree(s) containing this utterance (separated by ||| in the file).

'ptb_treenumbers':     (list of int) The tree numbers in the PtbBasename+.mrg
    




### Data Splits

I used info from the [Probabilistic-RNN-DA-Classifier](https://github.com/NathanDuran/Probabilistic-RNN-DA-Classifier) repo:
The same training and test splits as used by [Stolcke et al. (2000)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/ws97).
The development set is a subset of the training set to speed up development and testing used in the paper [Probabilistic Word Association for Dialogue Act Classification with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326640934_Probabilistic_Word_Association_for_Dialogue_Act_Classification_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_19th_International_Conference_EANN_2018_Bristol_UK_September_3-5_2018_Proceedings).

|Dataset    |# Transcripts  |# Utterances   |

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

The SwDA is not inherently linked to the Penn Treebank 3 parses of Switchboard, and it is far from straightforward to align the two resources Calhoun et al. 2010, ยง2.4. In addition, the SwDA is not distributed with the Switchboard's tables of metadata about the conversations and their participants.
