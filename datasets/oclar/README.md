### Dataset Summary

The researchers of OCLAR Marwan et al. (2019), they gathered Arabic costumer reviews [Zomato website](https://www.zomato.com/lebanon)
on wide scope of domain, including restaurants, hotels, hospitals, local shops, etc.
The corpus finally contains 3916 reviews in 5-rating scale. For this research purpose, the positive class considers
rating stars from 5 to 3 of 3465 reviews, and the negative class is represented from values of 1 and 2 of about 451
texts.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Opinion Corpus for Lebanese Arabic Reviews (OCLAR) corpus is utilizable for Arabic sentiment classification on services
reviews, including hotels, restaurants, shops, and others.

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in Arabic, mainly in Lebanese (LB). The associated BCP-47 code is `ar-LB`.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises a `pagename` which is the name of service / location being reviewed, a `review` which is
the review left by the user / client , and a `rating` which is a score between 1 and 5.

The authors consider a review to be positive if the score is greater or equal than `3`, else it is considered negative.

An example from the OCLAR data set looks as follows:

```
  "pagename": 'Ramlet Al Baida Beirut Lebanon',
  "review": 'مكان يطير العقل ويساعد على الاسترخاء',
  "rating": 5,
```

### Data Fields

- `pagename`: string name of the service / location being reviewed
- `review`: string review left by the user / costumer
- `rating`: number of stars left by the reviewer. It ranges from 1 to 5.

### Data Splits

The data set comes in a single csv file of a total `3916` reviews :
- `3465` are considered positive (a rating of 3 to 5)
- `451` are considered negative (a rating of 1 or 2)

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was created for Arabic sentiment classification on services’ reviews in Lebanon country. 
Reviews are about public services, including hotels, restaurants, shops, and others.

### Source Data

The data was collected from Google Reviews and [Zomato website](https://www.zomato.com/lebanon)

#### Who are the source language producers?

The source language producers are people who posted their reviews on Google Reviews or [Zomato website](https://www.zomato.com/lebanon).
They're mainly Arabic speaking Lebanese people.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The author's research has tackled a highly important task of sentiment analysis for Arabic language in the Lebanese
context on 3916 reviews’ services from Google and Zomato. Experiments show three main findings: 
1) The classifier is confident when used to predict positive reviews,
2) while it is biased on predicting reviews with negative sentiment, and finally 
3) the low percentage of negative reviews in the corpus contributes to the diffidence of LR.
