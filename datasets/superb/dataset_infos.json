{"asr": {"description": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven vital for advancing research in\nnatural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). The paradigm\npretrains a shared model on large volumes of unlabeled data and achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for various tasks with minimal adaptation. However, the\nspeech processing community lacks a similar setup to systematically explore the\nparadigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce Speech processing Universal\nPERformance Benchmark (SUPERB). SUPERB is a leaderboard to benchmark the\nperformance of a shared model across a wide range of speech processing tasks\nwith minimal architecture changes and labeled data. Among multiple usages of the\nshared model, we especially focus on extracting the representation learned from\nSSL due to its preferable re-usability. We present a simple framework to solve\nSUPERB tasks by learning task-specialized lightweight prediction heads on top of\nthe frozen shared model. Our results demonstrate that the framework is promising\nas SSL representations show competitive generalizability and accessibility\nacross SUPERB tasks. We release SUPERB as a challenge with a leaderboard and a\nbenchmark toolkit to fuel the research in representation learning and general\nspeech processing.\n\nNote that in order to limit the required storage for preparing this dataset, the\naudio is stored in the .flac format and is not converted to a float32 array.
