### Dataset Summary

This dataset provides the data for LAMA. The dataset include a subset
of Google_RE
(https://code.google.com/archive/p/relation-extraction-corpus/), TRex
(subset of wikidata triples), Conceptnet
(https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki) and Squad. There are
configs for each of "google_re", "trex", "conceptnet" and "squad",
respectively.

The dataset includes some cleanup, and addition of a masked sentence
and associated answers for the [MASK] token. The accuracy in
predicting the [MASK] token shows how well the language model knows
facts and common sense information. The [MASK] tokens are only for the
"object" slots.

This version of the dataset includes "negated" sentences as well as
the masked sentence. Also, certain of the config includes "template"
and "template_negated" fields of the form "[X] some text [Y]", where
[X] and [Y] are the subject and object slots respectively of certain
relations.

### Data Fields

The trex config has the following fields:
* uuid: the id
* obj_uri: a uri for the object slot
* obj_label: a label for the object slot
* sub_uri: a uri for the subject slot
* sub_label: a label for the subject slot
* predicate_id: the predicate/relationship
* sub_surface: the surface text for the subject
* obj_surface: The surface text for the object. This is the word that should be predicted by the [MASK] token.
* masked_sentence: The masked sentence used to probe, with the object word replaced with [MASK]
* template: A pattern of text for extracting the relationship, object and subject of the form "[X] some text [Y]", where [X] and [Y] are the subject and object slots respectively. template may be missing and replaced with an empty string.
* template_negated: Same as above, except the [Y] is not the object. template_negated may be missing and replaced with empty strings.
* label: the label for the relationship/predicate. label may be missing and replaced with an empty string.

### Data Splits

There are no data splits.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was gathered and created to probe what language models understand.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

See the reaserch paper and website for more detail. The dataset was
created gathered from various other datasets with cleanups for probing.


#### Who are the source language producers?

The LAMA authors and the original authors of the various configs.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

Human annotations under the original datasets (conceptnet), and various machine annotations.

#### Who are the annotators?

Human annotations and machine annotations.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

Unkown, but likely names of famous people.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

The goal for the work is to probe the understanding of language models.

### Discussion of Biases

Since the data is from human annotators, there is likely to be baises. 

[More Information Needed]

### Other Known Limitations

The original documentation for the datafields are limited.

## Additional Information

### Dataset Curators
