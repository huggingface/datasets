### Dataset Summary

Data-To-Text Generation involves converting knowledge graph (KG) triples of the form (subject, relation, object) into
a natural language sentence(s). This dataset consists of English KG data converted into paired natural language text.
The generated corpus consists of ∼18M sentences spanning ∼45M triples with ∼1500 distinct relations.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

The intended task is data-to-text generation, taking in a knowledge graph tuple and generating a natural language
representation from it. Specifically, the data is in the format the authors used to train a seq2seq language model
with the tuples concatenated into a single sequence.

### Languages

The dataset is in English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

Each instance consists of one KG triple paired with corresponding natural language.

### Data Fields

- `triple`: Wikipedia triples of the form `<subject> <relation> <object>` where some subjects have multiple
relations, e.g. `<subject> <relation1> <object1> <relation2> <object2> <relation3> <object3>`. For more details on
how these relations are grouped, please refer to the paper.
- `sentence`: The corresponding Wikipedia sentence.

### Data Splits

The dataset includes a pre-determined train, validation, and test split.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The goal of the dataset's curation and the associated modeling work discussed in the paper is to be able to generate
natural text from a knowledge graph.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

The data is sourced from English Wikipedia and it's associated knowledge graph.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the annotators?

[More Information Needed]

### Personal and Sensitive Information

[More Information Needed]

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

[More Information Needed]

### Discussion of Biases

From the paper:

> Wikipedia has documented ideological, gender6, and racial biases in its text. While the KELM corpus may still
contain some of these biases, certain types of biases may be reduced.

### Other Known Limitations
