entertainment,hobbit picture  four years away  lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of the hobbit.  the oscar winner said on a visit to sydney there was a  desire  to make it  but not before lengthy negotiations.  i think it s gonna be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen   said the new zealander. the rights to jrr tolkien s book are split between two major film studios. jackson  who is currently filming a remake of hollywood classic king kong  said he thought that the sale of mgm studios to the sony corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project. the 43-year-old was in the australian city to visit a lord of the rings exhibition  which has attracted 140 000 visitors since it opened in december.  the film-maker recently sued film company new line cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the middle earth trilogy. the fellowship of the ring from 2001 went on to make worldwide profits of $291 million (£152 million). jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake king kong  which is currently in production in wellington. the picture  which stars naomi watts and oscar winner adrien brody  is due to be released in december. jackson has also committed to making a film version of lovely bones  based on the best-selling book by alice sebold.
tech,game firm holds  cast  auditions video game firm bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  the company  which makes role playing games such as knights of the old republic and neverwinter nights  is seeking people aged 18 to 99. the canada-based company says it was looking for  a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters . everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer s fee for the use of their image. the company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in west edmonton  alberta  on friday and saturday  bringing along a piece of photo identification.   there are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical bioware game   said shauna perry  bioware s audio and external resources producer.  those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people  people with interesting faces.  she added:  not everyone is a model in the world so we don t want just models in our games.  people chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. hundreds of photos of the person s head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3d.  the 3d model will look exactly like the person - it s really quite incredible how detailed they are   said ms perry. she said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game.  we cannot give people any control over how the images are used.  but their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one  the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.
politics,clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country  home secretary charles clarke has said.  he is proposing a points system similar to australia s but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke  who will unveil his plans on monday  said economic migration helped the uk but  needed proper policing . the lib dems say they will look at his plans  but tory liam fox said his party offered a  clear choice  on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had  done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit  on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas.  the home secretary said  by 2008  he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken  to  ensure we can know everybody who is in the country . speaking on bbc one s breakfast with frost  he said  economic migrants are of great value to this country   but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a  burden on society . he said:  we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills  talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country  and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.   the home secretary  whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday  also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry.  the issue of who does come into this country  and whether they are entitled to be in this country  who does settle here  how we have border controls  is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate   he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum  the jury is still out on the home office s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.   mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees . but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. trevor phillips  chairman of the commission for racial equality  called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain s hospitality was being tested by immigration.  tell that to the 44 000 doctors in the nhs and the 70 000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means   he said.  ditto the teachers  from south africa  australia  jamaica  who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.  the refugee council said mr howard s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.

tech,fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest.  the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei  taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers  ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  in total  the tfc tower has 61 lifts  34 of them double-deckers  and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december.  the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds  while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include:    - a pressure control system  which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers  preventing  ear popping    - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft      the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us   said masayuki shimono  president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955.  as such  it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition  when the record was 426m per minute  or 25.6 km/h  less than half the speed of the new record   said hein le roux  specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur  malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.
