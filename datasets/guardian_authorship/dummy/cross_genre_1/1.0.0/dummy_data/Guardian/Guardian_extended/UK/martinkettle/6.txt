The strategic rail authority's decision to close 40 miles of the west coast main line for four months to upgrade the nation's most important rail artery may seem like a major engineering operation. But it would have had their Victorian predecessors guffawing in condescending disbelief at its small scale and long time-scale. When it came to upgrading Britain's rail tracks, the steam age could move with a lightning pace and precision that seem unmatched by the computer age.  Probably the greatest of all feats of Victorian railway building reorganisation occurred over the weekend of May 21 and 22, 1892, when the Great Western Railway was finally converted from the broad gauge introduced by its founder, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, to the standard gauge still in use by Britain's rail network today.  Over two days, an army of 5,000 navvies and engineers completed the task of replacing the remaining 7ft in gauge railway with the standard 4ft 8in gauge along the line from Paddington to Penzance. On Friday May 20, the GWR's final broad gauge train, the 10.15am Cornishman express, left Paddington for the west country. As it passed each section of remaining broad gauge track, navvies pulled up the old rails. Along much of the line standard gauge rails were already in place alongside the old. But on the 36-mile stretch from Exeter to Truro, the entire track was relaid.  "It was without doubt one of the most amazing feats of organisation and precision in railway history," said Tim Bryan, curator of Steam, the GWR museum at Swindon.  The conversion was completed without a single accident to the workforce. On Monday May 23, the Great Western's official history recalls proudly, "the whole regular service for passenger trains recommenced".  The 1892 conversion came 20 years after the even larger partial switch from the old broad gauge. In 1872, the 424-mile network of the South Wales Railway was converted in a relatively laggardly 28 days.
