Andrew Norfolk of the Times picks up the Orwell Prize for his brilliant reporting of the Rochdale grooming case, and all journalists can be proud of that. But what about Rochdale lessons-cum-punditry? The Jimmy Savile aftermath? The abusing horrors of the latest Oxford case? Suzanne Moore in the Guardian says that men – and that means male columnists, too – need to pick up the cudgels of reflection and morality: "Every time dreadful things happen, nice guys say: don't associate this with my gender, don't hate me. This is not good enough." And you can quietly see what she means. We know what Zoe Williams, Janice Turner, Grace Dent and many more distinguished women have to say about this swamp of male depravity … but Boris Johnson, Simon Jenkins, Matthew Parris, Charles Moore and all haven't exactly risen to the implied challenge. David Aaronovitch has made useful cautionary points about an engulfing hysteria, but never quite confronted what happened – as opposed to the reactions it fuelled. The job of examining the wrongs done to women by men has been left, by and large, to women. The nice, thoughtful guys have looked elsewhere. Of course it's hard to remotely accept any responsibility for deeds you, personally, find repugnant. Of course there may be less gender perspective to add than Moore supposes. But when Rochdale and Oxford present are lumped in with the long, long trail from the BBC of the 1960s, it's sadly ridiculous for this to become a "women's issue" pursued only by women pundits. Think humanity, then mind the gaps.
