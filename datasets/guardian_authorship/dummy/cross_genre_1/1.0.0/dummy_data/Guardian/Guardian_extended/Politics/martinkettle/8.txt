Charles Kennedy's strategic decision to target the Conservative party is a clear reflection of the electoral battleground that confronts the Liberal Democrats if they are to build on the total of 52 parliamentary seats they won in the 2001 general election. Most of the seats the Liberal Democrats have a good chance of winning next time round are held by Tory MPs. And the Tories are also the closest challengers in the overwhelming majority of the seats the Liberal Democrats now hold.  Eight out of the 10 most likely Liberal Democrat target seats at the next election are held by the Tories, compared with only two by Labour. Tories also hold 16 of the Liberal Democrats' top 20 targets. A campaign focused on the Tories therefore makes perfect sense if Mr Kennedy is to maintain the momentum of the last two general elections.  Taunton, which the Liberal Democrats lost to the Conservatives in 2001 by a majority of just 235 votes is the Tory seat most vulnerable to Mr Kennedy's party.  A 4% swing from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats would net several of the Conservatives' few remaining big names.  There is self-preservation involved in the anti-Conservative focus too, since Tory challengers are in second place in 44 out of the 52 current Liberal Democrat-held seats.
