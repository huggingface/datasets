President George Bush has chosen as ambassador to Britain a millionaire Texas investment banker and horse-racing mogul who has hosted four of the Queen's private visits to the United States. Will Farrish will succeed Philip Lader, a Clinton appointee, later this year. The job, traditionally a reward for campaign contributions, comes with one of the most attractive tied houses in London, in the heart of Regent's Park.  Mr Farrish, a noted anglophile, is a longtime Bush family friend who hosted Mr Bush's visit to the Kentucky Derby, the blue riband of the racing calendar, last summer. His horse, Secret Status, won last year's Kentucky Oaks.  Mr Farrish was in charge of George Bush Sr's blind trusts during his 1989-93 presidency, and has been a lifelong confidant of the family.  His millions, his impeccable Republican credentials, and his close ties to the Bush family will mark a wholesale change.  Mr Lader was a Clinton donor and adviser from South Carolina whose most celebrated qualification for the ambassadorship was that he regularly hosted the Clintons' "renaissance weekends" at his Hilton Head estate on the Atlantic coast.  It is Mr Farrish's role as one of the prime movers in the Kentucky bloodstock industry that will make him one of the most congenial appointments the house of Windsor could have wished for.  The Queen has stayed four times as Mr Farrish's private guest at his Kentucky stud farms, lending him a social cachet for which he waived his stud fees for his royal visitor.  Though he lives in Kentucky, Mr Farrish is by birth a Texan and owns a ranch there, at which Mr Bush Sr has gone quail hunting.
