There is much to like about Vince Cable and much to admire. But nothing reveals the secret of his success as graphically as his persona. While Nick Clegg, his party leader, subscribes to the David Cameron theory that successful politicians ought to look and sound like Rolls-Royce salesmen, Cable has the demeanour of a Yorkshire undertaker on a day trip to Bridlington. His willingness to answer to the name of "Vince" is more proof of disdain for fashion. He is the politics of substance made flesh. His popularity is a vindication of those of us who argue that ideas are more important than image. If he had not stooped to make that Cambridge Union joke about the prime minister evolving from Stalin into Mr Bean, he might have achieved parliamentary sanctification ahead of Frank Field. As it is, he will have to be satisfied with his memoirs being received with applause that few other politicians, writing in such an inhibited style, could expect. "Vince" can describe personal tragedy without being mawkish and revisit party rivalries without being suspected of repaying old debts because he is "genuine" – not bogus genuine, but genuine genuine.
