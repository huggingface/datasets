Many parents wonder about the point of having children. They burn up your money, sleep and social life, and then blame you for all their problems. In politics, however, children are a source of perpetual joy. They must be seen and heard at every opportunity. In 1993, Michael Howard found that children were just what he needed to prevent the young Tony Blair outflanking the Tory government on the Right. The parents of children as young as 10 would be fined, and in extreme cases jailed, if their sprogs didn't comply with court orders, the tough Home Secretary announced. Alun Michael, Labour's Home Affairs spokesman, condemned Howard's plans as 'unworkable and pathetic'. But in the jailing of parents as in so much else New Labour proved it could be flexible. In the run-up to the 1997 election, Jack Straw promised that 'parental supervision orders' would be imposed on the parents of children who played truant. Failure to comply would lead to a spell in the slammer. Howard matched him word for word. Once in power, New Labour announced fines and possible prison sentences for parents in November 1997. It did so again in September 1999. And in March 2000. And in October 2000. And in this year's Queen's Speech. None of these schemes will ever amount to much because the courts have the sense to realise that jailing parents often means sending children into council care - which short of shooting the dears is about the worst thing you can do to them. But nothing stops this Government. Even though the Queen's Speech was scarcely a month old, Charles Clarke tried to divert attention from the Cherie affair last week by announcing - but, of course - the fining and jailing of parents. The media treated it as a serious and novel measure. What with one thing and another in the past fortnight, journalists have given the impression of being cynical brutes. In truth, we are drooling innocents with the memories of goldfish with learning difficulties.
