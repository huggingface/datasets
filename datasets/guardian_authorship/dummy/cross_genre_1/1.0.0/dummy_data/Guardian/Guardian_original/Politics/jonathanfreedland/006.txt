You may have drawn up your own list: a catalogue of decisions that have to be made in the year that begins today. Perhaps 2003 is when you finally resolve to change jobs or move house. Maybe this is the year a key relationship has to shift gear. Whatever dilemmas we face individually, we've certainly got a stack of decisions to make collectively. Think of them as an alternative set of new year resolutions: questions we have to resolve in 2003. Here are just six that loom over Britain and the world - and a reckless prediction for each one.  <B> 1. War on Iraq:</B> Any day now Americans have to decide whether to take on Saddam Hussein immediately - or whether to delay a year. The advantage of a wait is nakedly political: it would give George W Bush the glory of victory in the election year of 2004, rather than seeing him peak too early (his father's mistake in winning Gulf War I in 1991 rather than in election year 1992). But delay has a cost too. The world can't remain on hair-trigger alert for another 12 months without getting twitchy and irritable. As the North Korea flap shows, other global crises get neglected when the world's hyperpower is focused so obsessively elsewhere. America's allies almost want to get this thing over with. Also, the longer this   stand-off drags on, the more Bush risks looking indecisive. The argument has raged in the Bush inner circle for a while now, but a decision has to come soon: the winter window will close next month, only reopening in November.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Desert Storm The Sequel is a 2003 production.  <B> 2. Israeli elections:</B> Voters in Israel have to choose a new government on January 28. If they pick Labour's dovish ex-general, Amram Mitzna, they will be opting for an instant restart in the peace process with the Palestinians. If they re-elect Ariel Sharon, they will be asking for - and will get - more of the same: a military crackdown on terrorism and no more diplomatic activity than the minimum required to keep Washington happy.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> Sharon wins handsomely, but goes on to rule with a narrow, rightwing coalition that struggles to survive long into 2004.  <B> 3. The euro:</B> By June Gordon Brown has to decide whether his five economic tests for British entry into the single currency have been met. If he says yes, a referendum will prove the biggest challenge for New Labour since the 1997 election. If he says no, Tony Blair's ambition of a "Britain at the heart of Europe" will remain unfulfilled.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> The chancellor has already made his decision. (Witness Brown ally and T &amp; G leader Bill Morris's call for no referendum in 2003.) Brown will declare that his five criteria have "not yet" been met, marking the clearest breach yet with euro-enthusiast Tony Blair. It will also postpone (if it was ever going to happen) the handover of power famously promised in 1994's Granita summit: Brown will have to wait for his prize and 2003 may be the year he gets impatient.  <B> 4. A new Europe:</B> By this summer, the EU will be handed a draft of a new constitution, even mulling a new name. Former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing has led a constitutional convention which aims to do for the EU what Philadelphia in 1787 did for the US. It hopes to restructure the union to cope with 26 (or more) states, making the EU the greatest supranational enterprise in history. Blair is said to regard the outcome of Giscard's convention as "more important than Iraq."  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> this will be no Philadelphia. Instead of a clear, simple new structure to please logical purists, Europe's leaders will broker and horsetrade their way to a fudge. Britain (and France) will get their way with a strong council of ministers, keeping national governments as key players, with foreign policy and taxation still in national, not EU, hands. Federalists will be happy with a beefed-up commission and greater integration on justice and home affairs. Giscard will not win a name-change to United Europe: it will still be the EU.  <B> 5. Britain's mini general election:</B> On May 1 UK voters everywhere but London should have a chance to cast ballots. Elections for the Scottish parliament and for the Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies are due to coincide with council contests throughout England. Voters have to deliver their verdict on the newly devolved institutions - and to decide whether to give Labour a bloody nose in time-honoured, mid-term fashion. Toughest of all, the UK government must decide whether or not to allow elections to go ahead in Northern Ireland at all. If they do, Sinn Fein is likely to emerge as the largest nationalist party, with anti-agreement unionists enjoying similar success.  <B> Reckless prediction: </B> Labour remain in charge in both Scotland and Wales, though   still reliant on coalition allies the Lib Dems. Edinburgh might see a boost for the nationalists, building on their low base of 1999, while in Cardiff, Plaid Cymru fail to repeat their high-watermark performance of four years ago. Both struggle with turnout, especially in Wales where Labour already predicts voter participation of 35% or below. In England, Tories do well - but is it well enough?<B> 6. The future of IDS:</B> In 2003 the Conservatives will have to decide whether to stick with Iain Duncan Smith - or dump him. May 1 could be crucial. If Tories fail to poll above the 33% they won under William Hague in 2001, the IDS-must-go cry will become deafening.  <B> Reckless prediction:</B> On a low turnout, Conservatives scrape to or just above 2001 levels - giving IDS a reprieve. But the whispers and sniping intensify over the summer, leading to full-blown plotting in time for the party conference in the autumn. Eventually the Tories' instinct for self-preservation kicks in, as they realise a failure to ditch IDS in 2003 will leave a new leader only 18 months to prepare for battle with Tony Blair. Expect 12 or more months of Tory bloodletting. Oh, and a happy new year.<B>
