At his monthly press conference yesterday, Tony Blair told Oona Blackman, a journalist on the Daily Mirror: "Sorry, darling, I'll get to you." Would that get your hackles up? Or would you think, "Here's a good turn, I'm practically family. In a couple of weeks, he'll be telling me what he really thinks of the death penalty vis-a-vis Saddam Hussein."It is fine among family members. Well, it is fine from parents to children. From children to parents it sounds a bit patronising, a bit "your time is past, now I get to call you treasure."Between siblings, it's fine but affected (you never called one another darling when you were eight, now did you?) Between lovers it is, of course, obligatory. Between friends it's OK but choose your endearments carefully. If you blow all your sweet nothings on friends, your life-partner will be piqued.In the workplace, it would never be OK for a man thus to address a female subordinate, but between female peers it tends to be OK, except that a pleasing term should not be used to take the sting out of an annoying request ("Honey, would you mind terribly staying late? I'd do it myself, only I have to get to Fenwicks before they sell out of that expensive thing that you probably can't afford"). And you have to be careful of the way one endearment slides into another. One minute, you're calling your co-worker "darling", and the next you'll call him or her "tootletots" or "perfect pie" or, worse, "hot stuff" or "professor big trousers". And that is weird.As prime minister, I would be inclined to steer away from love bombs altogether, since it's not very authoritative. If he wants to mix it up a bit with unexpected modes of address, he could do worse than "pal" and "matey moo".
