In one of their few decision which could be described as being made on the grounds of good taste, the organisers of the Millennium Dome rejected a plan to exhibit 'Piss Flowers' by Helen Chadwick, a series of bronze moulds taken from cavities left after she had risked hypothermia for her art by peeing in the snow during a tour of Canada.  It was felt to be more seemly to replace her holes with an enormous Perspex case filled with tens of thousands of leaf-cutter ants. The insects symbolised 'communal, instinctive minds, working together, carrying bright flecks of leaf along paths designed to resemble the tracks of a silicon chip'. The chips were powering the dotcom companies whose success was thrilling speculators the world over.  Whether the substitution of the ants was much of an improvement was difficult to judge. In their native South America, leaf-cutters are better known for their appetites than their symbolic representation of the internet. About a million march in unstoppable columns which strip trees in the rain forest and munch their way through the crops of destitute peasants with ruthless speed. They are parasitic and mindless agents of destruction.  Speaking of which, the case of Philip Anschutz, the founder and chairman of Qwest Communications, has resurfaced. His American telecoms company had been a wonder of the dotcom bubble. In 1999, Anschutz sold share options worth $1.5 billion (£960,000 million). He picked a good time to bail out of his company. By 2002, Qwest had lost 90 per cent of its value after it admitted inflating profits.  Last week he agreed to pay a $4.4m fine to settle allegations that he had accepted gifts of shares from investment banks which hoped he would send business their way. Despite his record, New Labour considers him a fit and proper person to take over the Dome, its own bubble by the Thames.  Every night I pray that the Dome story will never go away, and it looks as if my prayers are being answered.
