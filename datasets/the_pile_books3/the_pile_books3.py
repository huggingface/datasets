"""The BookCorpus dataset based on Shawn Presser's work https://github.com/soskek/bookcorpus/issues/27 """

_DESCRIPTION = """\
This dataset is Shawn Presser's work and is part of EleutherAi/The Pile dataset. \
This dataset contains all of bibliotik in plain .txt form, aka 197,000 books processed in exactly \
the same way as did for bookcorpusopen (a.k.a. books1). seems to be similar to OpenAI's mysterious \
"books2" dataset referenced in their papers. Unfortunately OpenAI will not give details, so we know \
very little about any differences. People suspect it's "all of libgen", but it's purely conjecture.
