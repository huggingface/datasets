An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
{

    "question_id": "ATIS_dev_0",
    "question_text": "what flights are available tomorrow from denver to philadelphia ",
    "split": "dev"
}
```

#### QDMR-high-level

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 15.23 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 6.24 MB
