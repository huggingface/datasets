## Dataset Description

- **Repository:** [Dataset Repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/end-to-end-negotiator) 
- **Paper:** [Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning for Negotiation Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05125)

### Dataset Summary

A large dataset of human-human negotiations on a multi-issue bargaining task, where agents who cannot observe each otherâ€™s reward functions must reach an agreement (or a deal) via natural language dialogue.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Train end-to-end models for negotiation

### Languages

The text in the dataset is in English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

{'dialogue': 'YOU: i love basketball and reading <eos> THEM: no . i want the hat and the balls <eos> YOU: both balls ? <eos> THEM: yeah or 1 ball and 1 book <eos> YOU: ok i want the hat and you can have the rest <eos> THEM: okay deal ill take the books and the balls you can have only the hat <eos> YOU: ok <eos> THEM: <selection>',
 'input': {'count': [3, 1, 2], 'value': [0, 8, 1]},
 'output': 'item0=0 item1=1 item2=0 item0=3 item1=0 item2=2',
 'partner_input': {'count': [3, 1, 2], 'value': [1, 3, 2]}}

### Data Fields

`dialogue`: The dialogue between the agents. \
`input`: The input of the firt agent. \
`partner_input`: The input of the other agent. \
`count`: The count of the three available items. \
`value`: The value of the three available items. \
`output`: Describes how many of each of the three item typesare assigned to each agent

#### Who are the annotators?

Human workers using Amazon Mechanical Turk. They were paid $0.15 per dialogue, with a $0.05 bonus for maximal scores. Only workers based in the United States with a 95% approval rating and at least 5000 previous HITs were used.
