{"default": {"description": "GooAQ is a large-scale dataset with a variety of answer types. This dataset contains over\n5 million questions and 3 million answers collected from Google. GooAQ questions are collected\nsemi-automatically from the Google search engine using its autocomplete feature. This results in\nnaturalistic questions of practical interest that are nonetheless short and expressed using simple\nlanguage. GooAQ answers are mined from Google's responses to our collected questions, specifically from\nthe answer boxes in the search results. This yields a rich space of answer types, containing both\ntextual answers (short and long) as well as more structured ones such as collections.\n", "citation": "@article{gooaq2021,\n  title={GooAQ: Open Question Answering with Diverse Answer Types},\n  author={Khashabi, Daniel and Ng, Amos and Khot, Tushar and Sabharwal, Ashish and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh and Callison-Burch, Chris},\n  journal={arXiv preprint},\n  year={2021}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://github.com/allenai/gooaq", "license": "Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "question": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "short_answer": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "answer": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "answer_type": {"num_classes": 6, "names": ["feat_snip", "collection", "knowledge", "unit_conv", "time_conv", "curr_conv"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "gooaq", "config_name": "default", "version": {"version_str": "1.1.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 1102827066, "num_examples": 5030530, "dataset_name": "gooaq"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://github.com/allenai/gooaq/raw/main/data/qoogle.jsonl": {"num_bytes": 1467162788, "checksum": "7c57029dbac90db21c7abcb3dcdbf9cd9f83f9a1d24815a2d8c0663fe13e4a17"}}, "download_size": 1467162788, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 1102827066, "size_in_bytes": 2569989854}}
