Ltd (\u2018the applicant\u2019), an exporting producer in the People's Republic of China (\u2018PRC\u2019) of trichloroisocyanuric acid.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(3) The product under review is trichloroisocyanuric acid and preparations thereof (TCCA), also referred to as \u2018symclosene\u2019 under the international non-proprietary name (INN), currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a02933\u00a069\u00a080 and ex\u00a03808\u00a094\u00a020 (TARIC codes 2933698070 and 3808942020), and originating in the PRC (\u2018the product under review\u2019).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(4) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011\u00a0(2) under which imports into the Union of the product under review originating in the PRC, including the product produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 42,6 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned in Article 1(2) of that Regulation which are subject to individual duty rates.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS\n(5) The applicant claims that it did not export the product under review to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (\u2018the original investigation period\u2019).\n(6) Furthermore, the applicant claims that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product under review which are subject to the above-mentioned anti-dumping measures.\n(7) The applicant further claims that it has begun exporting the product under review to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(8) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the request for a review and have been given an opportunity to comment.\n(9) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product under review into the Union shall be subject.\n(10) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product under review from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n(11) In order to obtain information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.\n(13) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Selection of the market economy country\n(14) Since the applicant expressly waived the right to claim that market economy conditions prevail for it, normal value shall be determined on the basis of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC. The Commission envisages using Japan again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product under review from the PRC. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. According to the information available to the Commission, other market economy suppliers of the Union may be located, inter alia, in Switzerland, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Commission will examine whether there is production and sales of the product under investigation in those market economy third countries for which there are indications that production of the product under investigation is taking place.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(15) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product under review which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME-LIMITS\n(16) In the interest of sound administration, time-limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit any information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,\n\u2014 interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of Japan which is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value,\n\u2014 Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time-limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0COMMUNICATION WITH INTERESTED PARTIES\n(17) Interested parties are invited to make all submissions and requests by e-mail including scanned powers of attorney and certification sheets, with the exception of voluminous replies which shall be submitted on a CD-ROM or DVD by hand or by registered mail.

The interested party should immediately contact the Commission.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION\n(23) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of initiation of this review.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(24) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(25) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time-limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested party's rights of defence are being fully exercised.

This applies only in respect of the purchase of passenger cars and their fuel used for business purposes, and of expenditure relating to the lease, hire, maintenance and repair of such cars. Austria proposed a multipart draft solution for such compensation to its VAT own resources base, which includes a method for six sub-categories.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, the solution proposed by Austria was examined in its entirety by the Advisory Committee on Own Resources at its meeting on 10 December 2009. The examination revealed a difference of opinion in the Committee regarding one of the sub-categories of the solution. That sub-category concerns the methodology proposed for the calculation of the private use component of the compensation to the harmonised VAT own resources base. A draft decision declining that sub-category of the solution presented by Austria was submitted to the Advisory Committee on Own Resources which delivered a positive opinion on 10 December 2009.\n(3) When calculating private use, in the absence of actual data, alternative methods can be used. To guarantee that these methods contribute to uniformity in the calculation of the compensation they should be based on generally accepted assumptions.\n(4) Austria requires taxable persons to administer actual data about the private use of business cars. However, for reasons of administrative simplicity, Austria has proposed a solution for the calculation of private use incorporating general statistical data combined with depreciation rules devised for non-harmonised corporate income tax purposes. Since the proposed solution results in a private use element significantly lower than the proportion used by other Member States, it is contradictory to the required uniformity in the calculation of the compensation.

In June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.\n(3) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/498/EU\u00a0(3) provided for a Union financial contribution towards surveillance and other emergency measures against ASF implemented in 2013 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which are the Member States at direct threat of ASF introduction.\n(4) In January 2014 the disease has been reported in the wild boar population in Ukraine and it is still spreading in Belarus and in the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in January 2014 two ASF cases were detected in the wild boar population in Lithuania and after few days two further cases were reported in the wild boar in Poland. In both Member States the disease occurred at the border with Belarus. Therefore, the ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union represents a persistent threat to pig holdings within the Union, due to the fact that the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n(5) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this disease in the bordering territory of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These Member States have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intend to adopt to strengthen the protection of their territories and of other Member States.\n(6) During 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boar and domestic pigs. In order to better prevent ASF, certain surveillance activities need to be carried out in the territory of those Member States.\n(7) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the main precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU\u00a0(4) lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected.\n(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009\u00a0(5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, is higher than negligible and requires additional actions and controls at the points of entry.\n(9) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns to raise disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of the contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC\u00a0(6) to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced.\n(10) In 2014 ASF has been detected in the wild boar Lithuania and Poland and the two Member States are directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus. In order to minimise the risk of disease spread on their territory, Lithuania and Poland intend to decrease the density of susceptible hosts in low bio-security pig holdings of the infected area by promoting the slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings for at least one year. In December 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and cost estimates for the implementation of emergency measures during 2014 in the areas considered at higher risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These plans have been examined by the Commission for Union financial contribution and were found to comply with Directive 2002/60/EC.\n(11) The actions undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for disease surveillance, cleansing and disinfection of vehicles and for the organisation of awareness campaigns are co-financed at a rate of 50 %.\n(12) The actions undertaken by Lithuania and Poland to decrease the density of pigs in the infected areas at the border with Belarus should be co-financed at a rate of 30 %.\n(13) As the planned measures submitted by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for emergency measures against the introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine to be carried out in 2014 are a sufficiently detailed framework in the meaning of Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No\u00a01268/2012\u00a0(7), the present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided for in the work programme for grants.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the

It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC\u00a0(4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902\u00a011\u00a000 and 1902\u00a019 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93\u00a0(5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 23 December 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 96.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 5.7.2005, p. 24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.

That letter stipulated that the measures would be cancelled once a democratically elected and accountable president and government had been installed.\nThe European Union is pleased to see that the new government elected in October and November 2005 appears determined to introduce democratic change and reform the working of the public sector. The European Union is particularly pleased that:\n\u2014 the parliamentary and presidential elections of October and November 2005 were free, transparent and fair,\n\u2014 freedom of expression and press freedom are respected,\n\u2014 the government is backing, and actively taking part in, the implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP).\nA number of difficulties are nevertheless delaying performance of the government's commitments in the area of human rights and the rule of law, as follows:\n\u2014 the Commission on Human Rights is in the process of being reorganised following the appointment of new commissioners by the government,\n\u2014 few prosecutions have been brought against members of the security forces guilty of serious human rights violations,\n\u2014 the new security forces are not yet fully operational,\n\u2014 the overhaul of the justice system is still under way,\n\u2014 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be operational in June 2006, but the budget allocated to it is not sufficient to enable it to perform all its tasks.\nFurther progress is therefore needed in the area of human rights and the rule of law.\nIn view of the above, the European Union believes that the Liberian government is showing the right attitude and a satisfactory determination to improve the situation in the country. The European Union would like to encourage the Liberian government to continue down this road.\nIt is therefore convenient to lift the appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nAn enhanced, structured political dialogue based on Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement will be conducted in order to continue strengthening respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance. The political dialogue will concern:\n\u2014 follow-up of action against corruption and implementation of the GEMAP,\n\u2014 the progress made by the Commission on Human Rights and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,\n\u2014 the reforms of the justice and security sectors,\n\u2014 ensuring active follow-up of the results of external audits of parastatal agencies and government financial institutions,\n\u2014 the prosecution of those involved in violations of human rights.\nAt their first meeting in the framework of the enhanced Article 8 political dialogue, the parties will establish the commitments to be given by the Liberian government.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1474", "1617", "3489", "383", "5622", "584", "5873", "6117"]}
