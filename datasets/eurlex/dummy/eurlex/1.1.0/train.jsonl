Ltd (\u2018the applicant\u2019), an exporting producer in the People's Republic of China (\u2018PRC\u2019) of trichloroisocyanuric acid.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PRODUCT\n(3) The product under review is trichloroisocyanuric acid and preparations thereof (TCCA), also referred to as \u2018symclosene\u2019 under the international non-proprietary name (INN), currently falling within CN codes ex\u00a02933\u00a069\u00a080 and ex\u00a03808\u00a094\u00a020 (TARIC codes 2933698070 and 3808942020), and originating in the PRC (\u2018the product under review\u2019).\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EXISTING MEASURES\n(4) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011\u00a0(2) under which imports into the Union of the product under review originating in the PRC, including the product produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 42,6 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned in Article 1(2) of that Regulation which are subject to individual duty rates.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GROUNDS\n(5) The applicant claims that it did not export the product under review to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (\u2018the original investigation period\u2019).\n(6) Furthermore, the applicant claims that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product under review which are subject to the above-mentioned anti-dumping measures.\n(7) The applicant further claims that it has begun exporting the product under review to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCEDURE\n(8) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the request for a review and have been given an opportunity to comment.\n(9) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a \u2018new exporter\u2019 review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product under review into the Union shall be subject.\n(10) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product under review from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Questionnaires\n(11) In order to obtain information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.\n(13) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Selection of the market economy country\n(14) Since the applicant expressly waived the right to claim that market economy conditions prevail for it, normal value shall be determined on the basis of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC. The Commission envisages using Japan again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product under review from the PRC. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. According to the information available to the Commission, other market economy suppliers of the Union may be located, inter alia, in Switzerland, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Commission will examine whether there is production and sales of the product under investigation in those market economy third countries for which there are indications that production of the product under investigation is taking place.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS\n(15) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product under review which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TIME-LIMITS\n(16) In the interest of sound administration, time-limits should be stated within which:\n\u2014 interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit any information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n\u2014 interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,\n\u2014 interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of Japan which is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value,\n\u2014 Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time-limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0COMMUNICATION WITH INTERESTED PARTIES\n(17) Interested parties are invited to make all submissions and requests by e-mail including scanned powers of attorney and certification sheets, with the exception of voluminous replies which shall be submitted on a CD-ROM or DVD by hand or by registered mail.

The interested party should immediately contact the Commission.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION\n(23) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of initiation of this review.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n(24) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data\u00a0(3).\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HEARING OFFICER\n(25) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time-limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested party's rights of defence are being fully exercised.

This applies only in respect of the purchase of passenger cars and their fuel used for business purposes, and of expenditure relating to the lease, hire, maintenance and repair of such cars. Austria proposed a multipart draft solution for such compensation to its VAT own resources base, which includes a method for six sub-categories.\n(2) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, the solution proposed by Austria was examined in its entirety by the Advisory Committee on Own Resources at its meeting on 10 December 2009. The examination revealed a difference of opinion in the Committee regarding one of the sub-categories of the solution. That sub-category concerns the methodology proposed for the calculation of the private use component of the compensation to the harmonised VAT own resources base. A draft decision declining that sub-category of the solution presented by Austria was submitted to the Advisory Committee on Own Resources which delivered a positive opinion on 10 December 2009.\n(3) When calculating private use, in the absence of actual data, alternative methods can be used. To guarantee that these methods contribute to uniformity in the calculation of the compensation they should be based on generally accepted assumptions.\n(4) Austria requires taxable persons to administer actual data about the private use of business cars. However, for reasons of administrative simplicity, Austria has proposed a solution for the calculation of private use incorporating general statistical data combined with depreciation rules devised for non-harmonised corporate income tax purposes. Since the proposed solution results in a private use element significantly lower than the proportion used by other Member States, it is contradictory to the required uniformity in the calculation of the compensation.

In June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.\n(3) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/498/EU\u00a0(3) provided for a Union financial contribution towards surveillance and other emergency measures against ASF implemented in 2013 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which are the Member States at direct threat of ASF introduction.\n(4) In January 2014 the disease has been reported in the wild boar population in Ukraine and it is still spreading in Belarus and in the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in January 2014 two ASF cases were detected in the wild boar population in Lithuania and after few days two further cases were reported in the wild boar in Poland. In both Member States the disease occurred at the border with Belarus. Therefore, the ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union represents a persistent threat to pig holdings within the Union, due to the fact that the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n(5) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this disease in the bordering territory of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These Member States have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intend to adopt to strengthen the protection of their territories and of other Member States.\n(6) During 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boar and domestic pigs. In order to better prevent ASF, certain surveillance activities need to be carried out in the territory of those Member States.\n(7) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the main precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU\u00a0(4) lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected.\n(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009\u00a0(5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, is higher than negligible and requires additional actions and controls at the points of entry.\n(9) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns to raise disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of the contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC\u00a0(6) to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced.\n(10) In 2014 ASF has been detected in the wild boar Lithuania and Poland and the two Member States are directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus. In order to minimise the risk of disease spread on their territory, Lithuania and Poland intend to decrease the density of susceptible hosts in low bio-security pig holdings of the infected area by promoting the slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings for at least one year. In December 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and cost estimates for the implementation of emergency measures during 2014 in the areas considered at higher risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These plans have been examined by the Commission for Union financial contribution and were found to comply with Directive 2002/60/EC.\n(11) The actions undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for disease surveillance, cleansing and disinfection of vehicles and for the organisation of awareness campaigns are co-financed at a rate of 50 %.\n(12) The actions undertaken by Lithuania and Poland to decrease the density of pigs in the infected areas at the border with Belarus should be co-financed at a rate of 30 %.\n(13) As the planned measures submitted by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for emergency measures against the introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine to be carried out in 2014 are a sufficiently detailed framework in the meaning of Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No\u00a01268/2012\u00a0(7), the present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided for in the work programme for grants.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the

It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC\u00a0(4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902\u00a011\u00a000 and 1902\u00a019 according to their destination.\n(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93\u00a0(5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["The rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on 23 December 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 22 December 2005.\nFor the Commission\nG\u00fcnter VERHEUGEN\nVice-President\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 78.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 96.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 172, 5.7.2005, p. 24.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.

That letter stipulated that the measures would be cancelled once a democratically elected and accountable president and government had been installed.\nThe European Union is pleased to see that the new government elected in October and November 2005 appears determined to introduce democratic change and reform the working of the public sector. The European Union is particularly pleased that:\n\u2014 the parliamentary and presidential elections of October and November 2005 were free, transparent and fair,\n\u2014 freedom of expression and press freedom are respected,\n\u2014 the government is backing, and actively taking part in, the implementation of the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP).\nA number of difficulties are nevertheless delaying performance of the government's commitments in the area of human rights and the rule of law, as follows:\n\u2014 the Commission on Human Rights is in the process of being reorganised following the appointment of new commissioners by the government,\n\u2014 few prosecutions have been brought against members of the security forces guilty of serious human rights violations,\n\u2014 the new security forces are not yet fully operational,\n\u2014 the overhaul of the justice system is still under way,\n\u2014 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be operational in June 2006, but the budget allocated to it is not sufficient to enable it to perform all its tasks.\nFurther progress is therefore needed in the area of human rights and the rule of law.\nIn view of the above, the European Union believes that the Liberian government is showing the right attitude and a satisfactory determination to improve the situation in the country. The European Union would like to encourage the Liberian government to continue down this road.\nIt is therefore convenient to lift the appropriate measures adopted under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nAn enhanced, structured political dialogue based on Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement will be conducted in order to continue strengthening respect for human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance. The political dialogue will concern:\n\u2014 follow-up of action against corruption and implementation of the GEMAP,\n\u2014 the progress made by the Commission on Human Rights and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,\n\u2014 the reforms of the justice and security sectors,\n\u2014 ensuring active follow-up of the results of external audits of parastatal agencies and government financial institutions,\n\u2014 the prosecution of those involved in violations of human rights.\nAt their first meeting in the framework of the enhanced Article 8 political dialogue, the parties will establish the commitments to be given by the Liberian government.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1474", "1617", "3489", "383", "5622", "584", "5873", "6117"]}

In accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the single programming document includes the following elements:\n(a) the strategy and priorities for the joint action of the Structural Funds and the Member State; their specific quantified targets; the ex ante evaluation of the expected impact, including on the environmental situation, and the consistency of the priorities with the economic, social and regional policies and the employment strategy of Germany;\nthe priorities are as follows:\n1. development of infrastructure;\n2. competitive companies, jobs for the future;\n3. research, technology, information, skills development;\n4. promotion of tourism;\n5. better urban structures and efficient rural areas;\n6. technical assistance;\n(b) a summary description of the measures planned to implement the priorities, including the information needed to check compliance with the State aid rules under Article 87 of the Treaty;\n(c) the indicative financing plan specifying for each priority and each year the financial allocation envisaged for the contribution from each Fund - including, for information, the total amount from the EAGGF Guarantee Section and indicating separately the funding planned for the regions receiving transitional support in respect of Objectives 2 and 5(b) and the total amounts of eligible public or equivalent expenditure and estimated private funding in the Member State.

The indicative financing plan puts the total cost of the priorities selected for the joint action by the Community and the Member State at EUR 2200903657 for the whole period and the financial contribution from the Structural Funds at EUR 536638000.\nThe resulting requirement for national resources of EUR 490349686 from the public sector and EUR 1173915971 from the private sector can be partly met by Community loans from the European Investment Bank and other lending instruments.", "1. The total assistance from the Structural Funds granted under the single programming document amounts to EUR 536638000.\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the Funds for the various priorities included in the single programming document, is set out in the financing plan annexed to this Decision.\n2. The indicative initial estimated breakdown among the Structural Funds of the total Community assistance available is as follows:\n- ERDF: EUR 475804351\n- ESF: EUR 60833649\n3. During implementation of the financing plan, the total cost or Community financing of a given priority may be adjusted in agreement with the Member State by up to 25 % of the total Community contribution to the single programming document throughout the programme period, up to a maximum of EUR 30 million, without altering the total Community contribution referred to in paragraph 1.", "This Decision is without prejudice to the Commission's position on aid schemes falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty that are included in this assistance and which it has not yet approved. Submission of the application for assistance, the programme complement or a request for payment by the Member State does not replace the notification required by Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\nCommunity financing of State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the Treaty, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, requires prior approval by the Commission under Article 88(3) of the Treaty, except where the aid falls under the de minimis rule or is exempted under an exemption regulation adopted by the Commission under Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 (now 87 and 88) of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid(2). In the absence of such exemption or approval, aid is illegal and subject to the consequences set out in the procedural regulation for State aid, and its part-financing would be treated as an irregularity within the meaning of Articles 38 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.\nConsequently, the Commission will not accept requests for interim and final payments under Article 32 of the Regulation for measures being part-financed with new or altered aid, as defined in the procedural regulation for State aid, granted under aid schemes or in individual cases, until such aid has been notified to and formally approved by the Commission.", "The date from which expenditure shall be eligible is 1 January 2000.

In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts.

Articles 7b and 7c and Annex\u00a0IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.\n(4) The request to recognise that the \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was first submitted to the Commission on 16 May 2011. The updated version of the scheme was submitted on 7\u00a0February 2014. The scheme operates in the United Kingdom and can cover combinable crops, such as cereals, oilseeds and sugar beet. This scheme covers the trading, transport and storage stages of agricultural feedstock from farm gate to first processor and, for the other stages, relies on other voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission. As such, it is the responsibility of the \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 to ensure that the recognition issued by the Commission on those schemes with which it jointly operates remains valid during the length of cooperation. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(5) Assessment of the \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 scheme found it to cover adequately all the sustainability criteria of Directive 98/70/EC and of Directive 2009/28/EC, except Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC. It does, however, provide accurate data on elements that\u00a0are\u00a0required by economic operators downstream the chain of custody to demonstrate compliance with Article\u00a07b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC and applies a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n(6) The evaluation of the \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing.\n(7) The \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 was assessed against legislation in force at the time of the adoption of this Decision. In the case of relevant changes in the legal basis the Commission should assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme still adequately covers the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.\n(8) In the case of changes in the scheme the Commission should assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,", "main_body": ["The \u2018Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018the scheme\u2019), submitted for recognition to the Commission on 7 February 2014, demonstrates that consignments of biofuels comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 7b(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\nThe scheme uses accurate data for purposes of Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC in as far as it ensures that all relevant information from economic operators upstream the chain of custody is transferred to the economic operators downstream the chain of custody.\nThe scheme may be used for demonstrating compliance with Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC up to the first processor of the raw materials.", "If the scheme, after adoption of this Decision, undergoes changes to its contents in a way that might affect the basis of this Decision, such changes shall be notified to the Commission without delay.

There remain great disparities between the Member States, however, in the granting of international protection and the forms that such protection takes.\n(3) In its Policy Plan on Asylum, adopted in June 2008, the Commission announced its intention to develop the CEAS by proposing a revision of the existing legal instruments in order to achieve greater harmonisation of the applicable standards and by strengthening support for practical cooperation between the Member States, in particular, by a legislative proposal to establish a European Asylum Support Office (the Support Office) in order to increase coordination of operational cooperation between Member States so that the common rules are implemented effectively.\n(4) In the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, adopted in September 2008, the European Council solemnly reiterated that any persecuted foreigner is entitled to obtain aid and protection on the territory of the European Union in application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, and other relevant treaties. It was also expressly agreed that a European support office would be established in 2009.\n(5) Practical cooperation on asylum aims to increase convergence and ensure ongoing quality of Member States\u2019 decision-making procedures in that area, within a European legislative framework. A substantial number of practical cooperation measures have already been undertaken in recent years, notably the adoption of a common approach to information on countries of origin and the establishment of a common European asylum curriculum. The Support Office should be established in order to strengthen and develop those cooperation measures.\n(6) In the interests of simplifying actions to support practical cooperation on asylum matters, and in so far as the Support Office should be entrusted with some of the tasks that are currently financed under the European Refugee Fund, it is necessary to transfer responsibility for some of the Community actions provided for in Article 4 of Decision No 573/2007/EC\u00a0(2) from the European Refugee Fund to the Support Office in order to ensure the best possible practical cooperation on asylum matters.\n(7) In order to take account of the reduced scope of the Community actions, the limit for their funding laid down in Decision No 573/2007/EC should be reduced from 10\u00a0% of the Fund\u2019s available resources to 4\u00a0% thereof.\n(8) The financial envelope for the implementation of Decision No 573/2007/EC should be reduced in order to free up resources for funding the Support Office.\n(9) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n(10) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the Position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it nor subject to its application,", "main_body": ["Decision No 573/2007/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

Therefore, the listing of EEX as an auction platform should be conditional upon EEX providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become a member of or a participant in the secondary market organised by EEX or of any other trading place operated by EEX or by any third party.\n(7) In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No\u00a01031/2010, when appointing an auction platform, the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform\u2019s successor. Such measures should be laid down in a clear and timely manner in an exit strategy that should be reviewed by the auction monitor.

Ltd, Hisense Import & Export Co. Ltd, Konka Group Co. Ltd, Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. Ltd, Skyworth Multimedia International (Shenzen) Co. Ltd, TCL King Electrical Appliances (Hui Zhou) Co. Ltd and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd, (the Companies) in conjunction with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME).\n(3) As a result, imports into the Community of the product concerned of PRC origin, produced by the Companies, and of a type covered by the undertaking (the product covered by the undertaking), were exempt from the definitive anti-dumping duties.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING\n(4) The undertaking offered by the Companies obliges them to, inter alia, export the product covered by the undertaking to the first independent customer in the Community at, or above, certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) and to respect certain quantitative ceilings laid down in the undertaking. These price levels and ceilings eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.\n(5) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the undertaking, CCCME and the Companies also agreed to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission and to allow on-the-spot verification visits at their premises in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports.\n(6) As noted in recital 239 of Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002, the undertaking specifically provides that a breach by any of the Companies or the CCCME shall be considered as a breach of the undertaking by all signatories. Failure to cooperate with the European Commission in monitoring the undertaking is considered as a breach of the undertaking.\n(7) In this regard, the Commission requested to carry out on-the-spot verification visits at the premises of CCCME and of the two companies with the largest reported volume of sales of the product concerned, namely Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd and Konka Group Co. Ltd. The Commission sent pre-verification letters to CCCME, Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd and Konka Group Co. Ltd with an indication of the dates for the on-the-spot verification. The CCCME and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd confirmed the acceptance of the on-the-spot verification visit requested by the Commission. However, Konka Group Co. Ltd refused to accept an on-the-spot verification visit, thereby breaching the undertaking.\n(8) Commission Decision 2006/258/EC\u00a0(4) sets out in more detail the nature of the breach found.\n(9) In view of the breach, acceptance of the undertaking offered by the Companies in conjunction with the CCCME has been withdrawn by Decision No 2006/258/EC. A definitive anti-dumping duty should therefore be imposed forthwith on imports of the product concerned exported to the Community by the companies concerned.\n(10) In accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation, the rate of the anti-dumping duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. As the investigation in question was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and resulting injury by Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002, it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping rate be set at the level and in the form imposed by that Regulation, namely 44,6\u00a0% of the net, cif free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty.\nC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AMENDMENT TO REGULATION (EC) No 1531/2002\n(11) In view of the above, Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002 should be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

On the basis of that mid-term review, certain amendments to Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 have been suggested.\n(2) The mid-term review includes suggestions and proposals for improving the implementation of development cooperation with South Africa, some of which were already made in the Country Strategy Paper of 2002 and have been taken into account in the 2003 to 2005 Indicative Programme. They concern, inter alia, mainstreaming of gender issues at all levels of the project cycle from planning to implementation, streamlining of administrative procedures, improving criteria for assessing project and programme design and clarification of the conditions for granting contributions from the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development (EPRD) to regional programmes.\n(3) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a02988/95 of 18\u00a0December 1995 on\u00a0the protection of the European Communities' financial interests\u00a0(3), it is possible to provide funding to the Republic of South Africa through direct budget support. Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 could, however, be interpreted as excluding untargeted budget support. In addition, Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01605/2002 of 25\u00a0June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(4) contains in Title\u00a0IV of Part Two specific provisions for \u2018External Actions\u2019. It is, therefore, appropriate to bring Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 into line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01605/2002 and with Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a02342/2002 of 23\u00a0December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No\u00a01605/2002 on\u00a0the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\u00a0(5).\n(4) In view of the implementation of the EPRD, and in particular of the 2000 to 2002 Multiannual Indicative Programme, Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 should be adjusted, in particular in relation to the adoption of sector-wide programmes, funding through budget support and the joint funding of projects and programmes in the field of regional cooperation and integration.\n(5) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 entered into force in 2000 and expires on 31\u00a0December 2006. However, Article 6(1) requires triennial indicative programming to be carried out. In order for programmes to correspond to the period of validity of the Regulation, provision should also be made for four-year indicative programmes.\n(6) The Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part\u00a0(6), to which South Africa is a signatory, was signed in Cotonou on 23\u00a0June 2000. Protocol 3 of that Agreement defines South Africa's qualified status under the Agreement.\n(7) Council Decision 1999/753/EC\u00a0(7) approved the provisional application of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of South Africa. Annex X to that Agreement stipulates that the Community will provide assistance for the restructuring of the South African wine and spirits sector and for the marketing and distribution of South African wines and spirits. The two corresponding Agreements on trade in wine and spirits have been approved by Council Decision 2002/51/EC\u00a0(8) and by Council Decision 2002/52/EC\u00a0(9) respectively. It is, therefore, necessary to include an additional amount in the financial reference amount provided for by Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000.\n(8) In practice, the European Development Fund Committee has been acting in the context of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 as the \u2018South Africa Committee\u2019. It is appropriate formally to establish that Committee.\n(9) Article 8(5) of Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 requests that the Commission consult the Committee on financing decisions it intends to take concerning projects and programmes of a value of over EUR\u00a05\u00a0million. For the sake of sound financial management and rationalisation of procedures, it is appropriate to raise this ceiling to EUR\u00a08\u00a0million.\n(10) Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 should, therefore, be amended accordingly,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No\u00a01726/2000 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

whereas it is consequently necessary to stimulate intensive  and ongoing cooperation at all levels in the indirect taxation administrations to ensure that they work together to complete the internal market;\nWhereas this will be achieved through optimizing the use of human resources in Member States and therefore through suitable vocational training;\nWhereas the measures taken in this sphere by each of the national administrations are not in themselves sufficient to achieve the objective being pursued; whereas it is consequently essential to reinforce national efforts through joint action to  increase the awareness of indirect taxation officials of the increasing Community dimension of their tasks and of the need to cooperate more closely together;\nWhereas only a better mutual knowledge of the organization, methods and procedures applied in the different Member States can ensure the climate of mutual confidence necessary for a proper functioning of the internal market;\nWhereas the experience acquired by the Community from the organization of the Matthaeus programme, intended for the customs officials of the Member States, showed the benefit of training activities, supplementing those organized at the national level,  in developing a Community spirit of the officials working in the internal market; whereas this experience must, mutatis mutandis, be spread to the indirect taxation area;\nWhereas, in these conditions, the implementation of a training programme at a Community level for indirect taxation officials (Matthaeus-Tax) constitutes one of the most appropriate ways to achieve this result;\nWhereas the Commission adopted a pilot project for 1991 and 1992 based on the exchange of indirect taxation officials between national administrations and training seminars; whereas the aim of this pilot project was to collect useful information to  allow the implementation of a more ambitious training programme extending over several years and supplemented by other training measures;\nWhereas the experience acquired during the pilot project indicated that there was an advantage in exchange officials having an involvement in the day-to-day activities of the host service; whereas this requirement will be met most effectively if the  exchange officials have sufficient knowledge of the language of the host country; whereas, for this purpose, it is essential that the national administrations organize language courses for their officials so they can participate more effectively in the  programme; whereas these courses must be of an ongoing nature and must cover, as far as possible, all the official languages of the Community;\nWhereas the legal status of exchange officials will be the same as that of national officials where, in performing their duties, their civil liability is put at issue by a third part and they will be informed about the civil liability rules applicable  to them in the host country;\nWhereas exchange officials will be bound by the same rules of professional secrecy as national officials, given that exchange officials will take part in the day-to-day work of the host administration;\nWhereas the number of officials undergoing an exchange should, as far as possible, amount to some 100 each year and be increased to the extent that budgetary, training and admission capacities permit;\nWhereas training measures supplementary to the exchange of officials between national administrations are essential to the achievement of the objective sought; whereas these measures may involve training seminars and the establishment of common training  programmes to be taught in Member States' schools;\nWhereas seminars form an ideal forum for the exchange of ideas between indirect taxation officials in the Community; whereas in these seminars, suggestions may emerge which could improve the legal instruments in force and facilitate cooperation between  the administrations concerned;\nWhereas the said seminars should concern those indirect taxation officials who belong, as necessary, to all categories and especially trainers in national administrations' schools, officials responsible for implementing indirect taxation law, especially  where it relates to the control of transactions involving other Member States, and officials responsible for combating all types of fiscal fraud;\nWhereas the setting up of common training programmes, in so far as necessary, constitutes a suitable means of making comparable training available to officials throughout the Community; whereas these programmes should include the teaching of Community  law as well as the study of Community institutions and their foundations, since indirect taxation officials will increasingly have to integrate these Community aspects;\nWhereas the implementation of these common programmes can be accomplished only if Member States provide the necessary facilities;

PROCEDURE\n(1) On 10 September 1997, the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China.\n(2) The complaint was lodged by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), on behalf of Degussa AG, the sole producer of thiourea dioxide in the Community.\n(3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.\n(4) The Commission, after consultation, accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide currently classifiable within CN code ex 2930 90 70 originating in the People's Republic of China.\n(5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producer. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.\nB. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING\n(6) By a letter of 6 April 1998 to the Commission, Cefic formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China citing changed circumstances as regards the Community industry having occurred after the lodging of the complaint. In particular, the complainant submitted that the situation of the sole Community producer had changed in the course of the investigation, mitigating the effect of the allegedly dumped imports.\n(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Council Regulation, (EC) No 384/96 when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The Commission considered that the present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceeding.\n(8) Interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.\n(9) Therefore the Commission has concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without the imposition of measures,", "main_body": ["The anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide currently classifiable within CN code ex 2930 90 70 and originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby terminated."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 17 July 1998.\nFor the Commission\nLeon BRITTAN\nVice-President\n(1) OJ L 56, 6. 3. 1996, p. 1.\n(2) OJ L 128, 30. 4. 1998, p. 18.\n(3) OJ C 323, 24. 10. 1997, p. 2.", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1309", "1591", "2213", "2771", "5969"]}

The value of theoretical VAT receipts;\n2. The discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the period.\nCalculation of theoretical VAT receipts\nThe theoretical VAT receipts are the amounts of VAT which would be collected if all units subject to VAT were to pay it as required by law.\nIn order to calculate theoretical VAT receipts, the first step is to bring the VAT base into line with current legislation: in other words, to identify all the transactions which are subject to non-deductible VAT. Final household consumption is treated as wholly subject to non-deductible VAT, whereas other categories of uses have to be broken down in order to determine a rate of non-deductibility. This calculation is made using the most highly disaggregated national accounts data available. The VAT base is calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\nThe second step is to apply the appropriate rate of VAT to each transaction constituting the VAT base as defined in the previous paragraph. The VAT rates applied must be those in force during the year for which the VAT base has been calculated. Theoretical VAT receipts are calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\nCalculation of the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the reference period\nThe discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts (calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules) and actual VAT receipts comprises four components:\n1. Time differences between treasury data and national accounts data;\n2. Ad hoc cancellations by the tax authorities of certain VAT claims in cases of insolvency;\n3. Evasion involving the buyers' connivance (with complicity) (cases where the buyer does not pay VAT to the seller);\n4. Evasion not involving the buyers' connivance (without complicity) (cases where the buyer pays VAT to the seller, but the latter fails to remit it to the tax authorities).\nAs a result, the value of evasion 'without complicity` is arrived at by deducting evasion 'with complicity` and insolvency-related cancellations from the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts, taking into account time differences between the transaction giving rise to the VAT and the collection of VAT receipts by the tax authorities.\nEvasion 'without complicity` = Theoretical VAT receipts less actual VAT receipts less time differences less insolvencies less missing receipts (evasion 'with complicity`)\nActual VAT receipts are the amounts actually collected by the tax authorities during the period to which the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts relates.\nAdjustments for time differences are intended to correct receipts so as to allow for the fact that some payments of VAT made in the current year (n) relate to the previous year (n-1) and that some VAT payable in respect of year n is not actually collected until the following year (n+1).\nThere may be instances where current legislation entitles the tax authorities to make ad hoc cancellations of VAT claims in cases of insolvency. In such cases, the value of the cancellations must be deducted from the difference between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts (unless it has already been taken into account in the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts).\nIn order to calculate the value of evasion 'with complicity`, only those activities should be taken into account in respect of which an adjustment for undeclared work (non-recording in statistical files of economically active units) has been made.\nBy using this method, applying the adjustments for undeclared work previously made to the output of branches of economic activity and multiplying the corresponding amounts for additional sales (undeclared sales) by the appropriate rates of VAT, it is possible to estimate the value of 'missing` VAT receipts which the tax authorities have been denied because of VAT evasion 'with complicity`.\nBy way of example: if, following an adjustment for undeclared work, the estimate of the household consumption of a given product, excluding VAT, is increased by 15 %, and if the rate of VAT applying to purchases of that product is 18,6 %, the amount owing to the tax authorities can be calculated as follows:\nMissing VAT receipts due to evasion 'with complicity` = value of sales of the product before adjustment \u0102\u0097 15 % \u0102\u0097 18,6 %.", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1095", "2761", "2769", "4585", "56", "6029"]}

The scope of harmonisation is defined in Article 3(1), which lists all the particulars that are compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs \u2018in accordance with Articles 4 to 17 and subject to the exceptions contained therein\u2019. Furthermore, Article 4(2) provides that other particulars in addition to those listed in Article 3(1) may be required, in the case of specified foodstuffs, by Community provisions or, in their absence, by national provisions.\n(4) Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC allows the adoption of non-harmonised national provisions if they are justified on one of the grounds listed therein, including, inter alia, the prevention of fraud and the protection of public health, and provided they are not of such a nature as to impede application of the definitions and rules laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC; therefore where draft national labelling provisions have been proposed in a Member State, it is necessary to examine their compatibility with the above-mentioned requirements and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community.\n(5) In accordance with Article 3(1) point 8 of Directive 2000/13/EC the indication of the place of origin or provenance is mandatory \u2018where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff\u2019. This provision, by providing an obligation to indicate the origin or the provenance of a food where other indications on the label of a given product could imply that such product comes from a different origin, provides an appropriate mechanism to counter the risk of consumers being misled.\n(6) In the case of poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat, the grounds presented by the Irish authorities do not allow for the conclusion that Irish consumers might, as a general rule, erroneously think that the products concerned come from a certain place.\n(7) Ireland has not provided any evidence that the draft Regulations are necessary to attain one of the objectives of the above-mentioned Article 18 or that the obstacle thus created is proportionate. It mentions only the aim of informing consumers on the origin of the products concerned. This ground alone is not sufficient to justify the draft Regulations.\n(8) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article 19, third paragraph of Directive 2000/13/EC.\n(9) The Irish authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft Regulations in question.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in line with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Ireland shall not adopt the draft Health (Country of Origin of Poultrymeat, Pigmeat and Sheepmeat) Regulations.\nThis Decision is addressed to Ireland."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 20 March 2009.\nFor the Commission\nAndroulla VASSILIOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0109, 6.5.2000, p.\u00a029.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 308, 25.11.2003, p.\u00a015.", "eurovoc_concepts": ["2771", "2836", "4687", "4691", "4692", "893"]}

These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).\n(8) The Commission has published a Notice\u00a0(3) on the 18 July 2007 to those companies in the Community of 27 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2008 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2008.\n(9) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system, it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2008.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,", "main_body": ["1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group I (chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 which may be used for essential medical uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 155\u00a0460,00 ozone-depleting potential (ODP) kilograms.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group I (chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115) and Group II (other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 which may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 56\u00a0213,60 ODP kilograms.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group III (halons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory use in the Community in 2008 shall be 418,7 ODP kilograms.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group IV (carbon tetrachloride) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 150\u00a0832,836 ODP kilograms.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group V (1,1,1-trichloroethane) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the European Union in 2008 shall be 381,5 ODP kilograms.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group VI (methyl bromide) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for laboratory and analytical uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 150,00 ODP kilograms.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of Group VII (hydrobromofluorocarbons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 0,96 ODP kilograms.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The quantity of controlled substances of group IX (bromochloromethane) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2008 shall be 13,368 ODP kilograms.", "The chlorofluorocarbon metered-dose inhalers listed in Annex I shall not be placed on markets where the Competent Authority has determined chlorofluorocarbons for metered-dose inhalers on those markets to be non-essential.", "During the period 1 January to 31 December 2008 the following rules shall apply:\n1.

More guidance for testing poorly-soluble substances is given in ISO 10634. However, an additional test method should be introduced for use with surfactants that are poorly-soluble in water. The additional test method proposed is ISO standard 10708:1997 \u2018Water quality \u2014 Evaluation in an aqueous medium of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds\u2019. The Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) concluded that ISO 10708 is of an equivalent standard to the test methods already included in Annex III to that Regulation and was in favour of its use.\n(3) To ensure a high level of health protection, information concerning detergent composition needs to be made more easily available to the general public. The address of a website should therefore be provided on the packaging of the detergent from which the list of ingredients mentioned in Section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 can be easily obtained.\n(4) There is a requirement to declare allergenic fragrances if they are added in the form of pure substances. However there is no requirement to declare them if they are added as constituents of complex ingredients such as essential oils or perfumes. To ensure better transparency to the consumer, allergenic fragrances in detergents should be declared irrespective of the way they are added to the detergent.\n(5) The list of ingredients intended for the general public that is given in section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 requires the use of specialised scientific nomenclature that may hinder rather than help the general public. Moreover, there are some minor inconsistencies between the information made available to the general public compared to that to be made available to medical personnel under section C of the same Annex. The ingredient information for the general public should be made more easily understandable by using the INCI nomenclature already in use for cosmetic ingredients, and sections C and D should be made compatible.\n(6) The definition of \u2018detergent\u2019 in the Regulation makes it clear that the rules on labelling apply to all detergents whether they contain surfactants or not. However, section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 lays down different rules for those industrial and institutional detergents that contain surfactants compared with those that do not. This difference in labelling requirements serves no useful purpose and should be eliminated.\n(7) Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 should be amended accordingly. In the interest of clarity it is appropriate to replace those Annexes.\n(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the detergents Committee,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.

The reference method for laboratory testing of surfactant ultimate biodegradability in this Regulation is based on the EN ISO standard 14593: 1999 (CO2 headspace test).\n1. EN ISO Standard 14593: 1999 \u2014 Water quality \u2014 Evaluation of ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds in aqueous medium \u2014 Method by analysis of inorganic carbon in sealed vessels (CO2 headspace test).

Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-D (manometric respirometry): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n5. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-F (MITI: Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\n6.

Pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied.\nB. Depending on the physical characteristics of the surfactant, one of the methods listed below may be used if appropriately justified\u00a0(2). It should be noted that the pass criterion of at least 70\u00a0% of these methods is to be considered as equivalent to the pass criterion of at least 60\u00a0% referred to in methods listed in point A. The adequacy of the choice of the methods listed below shall be decided on a case-by-case confirmation, in accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation.\n1. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-A (dissolved organic carbon DOC die-away): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied. The pass criteria for biodegradability measured according to the test shall be at least 70\u00a0% within 28 days.\n2. Directive 67/548/EEC method, Annex V.C.4-B (modified OECD screening-DOC die-away): pre-adaptation is not to be used. The 10-day window principle is not applied. The pass criteria for biodegradability measured according to the test shall be at least 70\u00a0% within 28 days.\nNB: Those of the abovementioned methods that are taken from Council Directive 67/548/EEC can also be found in the publication \u201cClassification, Packaging and Labelling of Dangerous Substances in the European Union\u201d, Part 2: \u201cTesting Methods\u201d.

The manometric respirometry and the MITI and two-phase BOD methods would not be appropriate in some cases because the high initial test concentration could be inhibitory.\u2019\nANNEX II\n\u2018ANNEX VII\nLABELLING AND INGREDIENT DATA SHEET\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling of contents\nThe following provisions on labelling shall apply to the packaging of detergents sold to the general public.\nThe following weight percentage ranges:\n\u2014 less than 5\u00a0%,\n\u2014 5\u00a0% or over but less than 15\u00a0%,\n\u2014 15\u00a0% or over but less than 30\u00a0%,\n\u2014 30\u00a0% and more,\nshall be used to indicate the content of the constituents listed below where they are added in a concentration above 0,2\u00a0% by weight:\n\u2014 phosphates,\n\u2014 phosphonates,\n\u2014 anionic surfactants,\n\u2014 cationic surfactants,\n\u2014 amphoteric surfactants,\n\u2014 non-ionic surfactants,\n\u2014 oxygen-based bleaching agents,\n\u2014 chlorine-based bleaching agents,\n\u2014 EDTA and salts thereof,\n\u2014 NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) and salts thereof,\n\u2014 phenols and halogenated phenols,\n\u2014 paradichlorobenzene,\n\u2014 aromatic hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 aliphatic hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 halogenated hydrocarbons,\n\u2014 soap,\n\u2014 zeolites,\n\u2014 polycarboxylates.\nThe following classes of constituent, if added, shall be listed irrespective of their concentration:\n\u2014 enzymes,\n\u2014 disinfectants,\n\u2014 optical brighteners,\n\u2014 perfumes.\nIf added, preservation agents shall be listed, irrespective of their concentration, using where possible the common nomenclature established under Article 8 of Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products\u00a0(1).\nIf added at concentrations exceeding 0,01\u00a0% by weight, the allergenic fragrances that appear on the list of substances in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC, as a result of its amendment by Directive 2003/15/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2) to include the allergenic perfume ingredients from the list first established by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetics and Non-food Products (SCCNFP) in its opinion SCCNFP/0017/98, shall be listed using the nomenclature of that Directive, as shall any other allergenic fragrances that are subsequently added to Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC by adaptation of that Annex to technical progress.\nIf individual risk-based concentration limits for fragrance allergens are subsequently established by the SCCNFP, the Commission shall propose the adoption, in accordance with Article 12(2), of such limits to replace the limit of 0,01\u00a0% mentioned above.\nThe website address, from which the list of ingredients mentioned in section D of Annex VII can be obtained, shall be given on the packaging.\nFor detergents intended to be used in the industrial and institutional sector, and not made available to members of the general public, the abovementioned requirements do not have to be fulfilled if the equivalent information is provided by means of technical data sheets, safety data sheets, or in a similar appropriate manner.\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Labelling of dosage information\nAs prescribed in Article 11(4), the following provisions on labelling shall apply to the packaging of detergents sold to the general public.
