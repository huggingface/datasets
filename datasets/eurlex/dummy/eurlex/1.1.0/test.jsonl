Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and animal products covered by that Directive are subject to the submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances listed in that Annex. Those plans are to be updated at the request of the Commission, particularly when certain checks render it necessary.\n(2) Commission Decision 2011/163/EU\u00a0(2) approves the plans provided for in Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC (\u2018the plans\u2019) submitted by certain third countries listed in the Annex thereto for the animals and animal products indicated in that list. Decision 2011/163/EU repealed and replaced Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\u00a0(3).\n(3) In the light of the recent plans submitted by certain third countries and additional information obtained by the Commission, it is necessary to update the list of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import certain animals and animal products, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC and currently listed in the Annex to Decision 2011/163/EU (\u2018the list\u2019).\n(4) Belize is currently included in the list for aquaculture and honey. However, Belize has not provided a plan as required by Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC. Therefore, Belize should be removed from the list.\n(5) Ghana has submitted a plan for honey to the Commission. That plan provides sufficient guarantees and should be approved. Therefore, an entry for Ghana for honey should be included in the list.\n(6) India has now carried out corrective measures to address the shortcomings in its residue plan for honey. That third country has submitted an improved residue plan for honey and a Commission inspection confirmed an acceptable implementation of the plan. Therefore, the entry for India in the list should include honey.\n(7) Madagascar has submitted a plan for honey to the Commission. That plan provides sufficient guarantees and should be approved. Therefore, honey should be included in the entry for Madagascar in the list.\n(8) Mauritius is currently included in the list for poultry but with a reference to footnote 2 in the Annex to Decision 2011/163/EU. That footnote restricts such imports to those from third countries using only raw material either from Member States or from other third countries approved for imports of such raw material to the Union, in accordance with Article 2 of that Decision. However, Mauritius has not provided the required guarantees for the plan for poultry. Therefore, the entry for that third country in the list should no longer include poultry.\n(9) Turkey has submitted a plan for eggs to the Commission. That plan provides sufficient guarantees and should be approved. Therefore, eggs should be included in the entry for Turkey in the list.\n(10) The entry for Singapore in the list includes aquaculture but with a reference to footnote 2 in the Annex to Decision 2011/163/EU. However, in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC, as amended by Commission Decision 2010/327/EU\u00a0(4), there is no reference to footnote 2 as Singapore submitted an approved plan for aquaculture. The Commission has not been advised of any change since the approval of that plan. Therefore, the entry for that third country in the list should be corrected by deleting the reference to that footnote for imports of aquaculture. For reasons of legal certainty, the entry for Singapore should apply retroactively from 15 March 2011, the date of application of Decision 2011/163/EU when the error in the entry regarding Singapore occurred. The competent authorities of the Member States have been informed accordingly and no disruption to imports has been reported to the Commission.\n(11) The Annex to Decision 2011/163/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["The Annex to Decision 2011/163/EU is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply from 1 November 2011.\nHowever, the amendment concerning the entry for Singapore shall apply from 15 March 2011.", "This Decision is addressed to the Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 14 October 2011.\nFor the Commission\nJohn DALLI\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 125, 23.5.1996, p. 10.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 70, 17.3.2011, p. 40.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 154, 30.4.2004, p. 44.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 147, 12.6.2010, p. 5.\nANNEX\n\u2018ANNEX\nCode ISO2 Country Bovine Ovine/caprine Porcine Equine Poultry Aquaculture Milk Eggs Rabbit Wild game Farmed game Honey\nAD Andorra X X  X\nAE United Arab Emirates      X X\u00a0(1)\nAL Albania  X    X  X\nAR Argentina X X  X X X X X X X X X\nAU Australia X X  X  X X   X X X\nBA Bosnia and Herzegovina      X\nBD Bangladesh      X\nBN Brunei      X\nBR Brazil X   X X X      X\nBW Botswana X   X       X\nBY Belarus    X\u00a0(2)  X X X\nCA Canada X X X X X X X X X X X X\nCH Switzerland X X X X X X X X X X X X\nCL Chile X X\u00a0(3) X  X X X   X  X\nCM Cameroon            X\nCN China     X X  X X   X\nCO Colombia      X\nCR Costa Rica      X\nCU Cuba      X      X\nCW Cura\u00e7ao       X\u00a0(4)\nEC Ecuador      X\nET Ethiopia            X\nFK Falkland Islands X X\nFO Faeroe Islands      X\nGH Ghana            X\nGL Greenland  X        X X\nGT Guatemala      X      X\nHK Hong Kong     X\u00a0(4) X\u00a0(4)\nHN Honduras      X\nHR Croatia X X X X\u00a0(2) X X X X X X X X\nID Indonesia      X\nIL Israel     X X X X   X X\nIN India      X  X    X\nIS Iceland X X X X  X X    X\u00a0(4)\nIR Iran      X\nJM Jamaica      X      X\nJP Japan      X\nKG Kyrgyzstan            X\nKR South Korea      X\nLK Sri Lanka      X\nMA Morocco      X\nMD Moldova            X\nME Montenegro X X X  X X  X    X\nMG Madagascar      X      X\nMK former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u00a0(5) X X X  X X X X  X  X\nMU Mauritius      X\nMX Mexico    X  X  X    X\nMY Malaysia     X\u00a0(4) X\nMZ Mozambique      X\nNA Namibia X X        X X\nNC New Caledonia X     X    X X X\nNI Nicaragua      X      X\nNZ New Zealand X X  X  X X   X X X\nPA Panama      X\nPE Peru     X X\nPF French Polynesia            X\nPH Philippines      X\nPN Pitcairn Islands            X\nPY Paraguay X\nRS Serbia\u00a0(6) X X X X\u00a0(2) X X X X  X  X\nRU Russia X X X  X  X X   X\u00a0(7) X\nSA Saudi Arabia      X\nSG Singapore X\u00a0(4) X\u00a0(4) X\u00a0(4)  X\u00a0(4) X X\u00a0(4)\nSM San Marino X  X         X\nSR Suriname      X\nSV El Salvador            X\nSX Sint Maarten       X\u00a0(4)\nSZ Swaziland X\nTH Thailand     X X      X\nTN Tunisia     X X    X\nTR Turkey     X X X X    X\nTW Taiwan      X      X\nTZ Tanzania      X      X\nUA Ukraine     X X X X    X\nUG Uganda      X      X\nUS United States X X X  X X X X X X X X\nUY Uruguay X X  X  X X   X  X\nVE Venezuela      X\nVN Vietnam      X\nYT Mayotte      X\nZA South Africa          X X\nZM Zambia            X\nZW Zimbabwe      X     X\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0Camel milk only.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0Export to the Union of live equidae for slaughter (food producing animals only).\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Only ovine animals.\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0Third countries using only raw material either from Member States or from other third countries approved for imports of such raw material to the Union, in accordance with Article 2.\n(5)\u00a0\u00a0The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the definitive nomenclature for this country will be agreed following current negotiations at UN level.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0Not including Kosovo which is at present under international administration pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0Only for reindeer from the Murmansk and Yamalo-Nenets regions.\u2019", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1166", "1338", "1445", "1644", "1729", "1841", "1907", "2121", "2531", "2718", "3191", "4164", "4580", "4747", "4841", "6268", "6569"]}

In order to improve control and traceability, standardised colour-coding of packaging, containers and vehicles should be used for trade in those by-products and processed products. The colours should be chosen in such a way so as to ensure that they can be easily distinguished, including by individuals with impaired colour vision.\n(4) For the purpose of clarity, a definition of \u2018colour-coding\u2019 should be added to the specific definitions in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.\n(5) Member States should have the possibility to establish systems or to lay down additional rules as regards the colour-coding of packaging, containers and vehicles used for the transport of the different categories of animal by-products and processed products within their territory. Such systems or rules should not confuse the standardised colour-coding system used for trade.\n(6) Member States should also have the possibility to require the marking of animal by-products originating in and remaining on their territory, in addition to the marking of specified risk materials required by Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\u00a0(2). Such marking, however, should not create barriers for trade or for exports to third countries.\n(7) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 sets out rules for the model commercial document which is to accompany animal by-products and processed products during transportation. Additional rules for such documents should be laid down in order to improve identification and traceability of animal by-products.\n(8) Articles 4, 5 and 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provide that certain processed animal by-products are to be permanently marked, where technically possible with smell, in accordance with Chapter I of Annex VI to that Regulation.\n(9) Chapter I of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides that processed products derived from Category 1 or 2 materials, with the exception of liquid products destined for biogas or composting plants, must be permanently marked, where technically possible with smell, using a system approved by the competent authority. So far, due to a lack of available scientific data on marking, no detailed rules for such marking were established.\n(10) On 17 October 2006, the Commission Joint Research Centre issued an implementation study to evaluate Glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH) as a suitable marker for animal by-products in rendering systems. On the basis of this report, detailed requirements for the marking of processed animal by-products should be laid down.\n(11) Those requirements should be without prejudice to the marking of processed products for use in organic fertilisers or soil improvers in order to fulfil the obligation not to apply them directly to land to which farmed animals might have access in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 181/2006 of 1 February 2006 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 as regards organic fertilisers and soil improvers other than manure and amending that Regulation\u00a0(3).\n(12) Certain exceptions from the requirement to mark processed products with GTH should be provided for, in particular as regards products moved for use or disposal with a method in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 of 19 January 2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards means of disposal or uses of animal by-products and amending its Annex VI as regards biogas transformation and processing of rendered fats\u00a0(4).\n(13) Annexes I, II and VI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n(14) In order to allow the Member States and the industry time to adapt to the new rules provided for by this Regulation, those rules should apply from 1 July 2008.\n(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annexes I, II and VI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.", "This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 2008.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 5 December 2007.\nFor the Commission\nMarkos KYPRIANOU\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L 273, 10.10.2002, p. 1.

During transport, a label attached to the packaging, container or vehicle must:\n(a) clearly indicate the category of the animal by-products or, in the case of processed products, the category of animal by-products from which the processed products were derived; and\n(b) bear the following words:\n(i) in the case of Category 3 material, \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d;\n(ii) in the case of Category 2 material (other than manure and digestive tract content) and processed products derived therefrom, \u201cnot for animal consumption\u201d; however, when Category 2 material is intended for the feeding of animals referred to in Article 23(2)(c) under the conditions provided for in that Article, the label shall instead indicate \u201cfor feeding to \u2026\u201d completed with the name of the specific species of those animals for the feeding of which the material is intended;\n(iii) in the case of Category 1 material and processed products derived therefrom, \u201cfor disposal only\u201d;\n(iv) in the case of manure and digestive tract content, \u201cmanure\u201d.\n3. Member States may establish systems or lay down rules for the colour-coding of packaging, containers or vehicles used for the transport of animal by-products and processed products originating in and remaining on their territory, provided that those systems or rules do not confuse the colour-coding system provided for in point 1(d).\n4. Without prejudice to point 3 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, Member States may establish systems or lay down rules for the marking of animal by-products originating in and remaining on their territory provided that those systems or rules do not conflict with the marking requirements laid down for processed products in Chapter I of Annex VI to this Regulation.\n5. By way of derogation from points 3 and 4, Member States may use the systems or rules referred to in those points for animal by-products originating in but not intended to remain on their territory if the Member State or third country of destination has communicated its agreement.\u2019\n(b) In Chapter X, point 1 is replaced by the following:\n\u20181. A commercial document in accordance with the model set out in this Chapter shall accompany animal by-products and processed products during transportation. However, for the transport of animal by-products and processed products on their own territory Member States may require:\n(a) to use a different commercial document, in paper or in electronic form, provided that such commercial document complies with the requirements laid down in point 2 of Chapter III;\n(b) that the quantity of the material referred to in point 2(c) of Chapter III is expressed in weight of the material in the commercial document;\n(c) that a copy of the commercial document is returned by the receiver to the producer to be kept by that producer in accordance with Chapter V as proof of arrival of the consignment.\u2019\n(3) Annex VI is amended as follows:\n(a) the title is replaced by the following:\n(b) Chapter I is amended as follows:\n(i) the title is replaced by the following:\n(ii) in part C, the following points are added:\n\u201810. In processing plants approved in accordance with Article 13, processed products as referred to in Article 4(2)(b) and (c) and Article 5(2)(b) and (c) shall be permanently marked with:\n(a) smell, where technically possible; and\n(b) glyceroltriheptanoate (GTH) in such a way that:\n(i) GTH is added to processed products that have undergone a preceding sanitising thermal treatment at a core temperature of at least 80\u00a0\u00b0C and remain subsequently protected from re-contamination; and\n(ii) all processed products contain homogenously throughout the substance a minimum concentration of at least 250 mg GTH per kg fat.\n11. The operators of processing plants approved in accordance with Article 13 shall have in place a system of constant monitoring and recording of parameters suitable to demonstrate to the competent authority that the required homogeneous minimum concentration of GTH as referred to in point 10(b) is achieved in the processed products referred to in point 10.\n12. The competent authority shall carry out a performance check of the monitoring and recording system referred to in point 11 to ascertain compliance with this Regulation and may, where necessary, request the testing of additional samples in accordance with the method referred to in the second paragraph of point 11.\n13. The marking with GTH shall not be required for processed products as referred to in Article 4(2)(b) and (c) and Article 5(2)(b) and (c), where such products are:\n(a) moved by a closed conveyer system, where such a system has been authorised by the competent authority, from the processing plant for:\n(i) immediate direct incineration or co-incineration; or\n(ii) immediate use in accordance with a method approved for Category 1 and 2 animal by-products in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Regulation (EC) No 92/2005; or\n(b) intended for research or for scientific use authorised by the competent authority.\u2019", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1755", "1854", "192", "2871", "4225", "4509", "5726", "6307"]}

These requests are justified in order to enable shipments to be made under adequate economic conditions.\n(7) Efforts should nevertheless be made to guarantee a degree of continuity in trade. This consideration and the desirability of efficient quota administration make it appropriate for operators to be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2001 equivalent to the quantity (for each textile category and each third country) which they imported in 2000.\n(8) For optimum use of the quantities it is appropriate to envisage that each operator, after 50 % utilisation of a licence, can introduce a new request for a licence, not exceeding a predetermined quantity, provided quantities are available in the quotas.\n(9) It is appropriate for the sake of sound administration to make import authorisations valid for nine months from the date of issue and to stipulate that the Member States can issue licences only after being notified of the Commission's decision and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and certify (except where specifically provided otherwise) that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities are however authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2002, licences of which at least 50 % has been used by the application date.\n(10) Kosovo, as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, is subject to international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) which has established a separate customs administration. It is, therefore, appropriate to identify the country concerned as the \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including Kosovo\".\n(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion expressed by the Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,", "main_body": ["This Regulation specifies certain rules concerning the management of quantitative quotas established by Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and applicable for 2001.", "The quotas referred to in Article 1 and shown in Annexes III B and IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 shall be allocated on a \"first come, first served\" basis according to the chronological order of receipt by the Commission of Member States' notifications of applications from individual operators, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities per operator stipulated in the Annex hereto.\nThese maximum quantities shall not, however, apply to operators able to prove to the competent national authorities when making their first application for 2001 that they imported, for given categories, given third countries and under import licences granted to them for 2000, more than the maximum quantities specified for each category.

However, audits have shown the need for certain amendments to the wording of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92\u00a0(2). In addition, the circumstances of the agricultural market have changed, making it necessary to amend a number of the rules governing the implementation of the programme.\n(2) Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 lays down that those Member States wishing to take part in the next annual plan for the distribution of food for the most deprived persons must inform the Commission by 15 February. To facilitate budget planning, that date should be brought forward to 1 February.\n(3) The first, second and third subparagraphs of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 specify certain time limits for the withdrawal of products from intervention stocks with which the Member State to which these stocks were assigned must comply. In order to improve compliance with these time limits it should be laid down that, in the event of failure to comply with the time limit, storage charges will no longer be covered by the Community budget. The fourth subparagraph of Article 3(2) of that Regulation stipulates that intervention products must be withdrawn within sixty days from the date of the award of the tender to the successful tenderer. Given that some language versions contain ambiguities regarding the act signalling the start of that period, the wording of that provision should be made more precise.\n(4) Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 does not specify a time limit for operations to mobilise products on the market under Article 2(3)(c) and (d) thereof. Products may therefore be mobilised until the end of the programme implementation period. A time limit which ensures consistency with the budget year should be established for these operations. It is also appropriate, within the framework of these operations, to lay down provisions regarding securities in order to ensure the satisfactory performance of the supply contract.\n(5) Given that the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 4(2)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 provides for the possibility of obtaining processed agricultural products or foodstuffs on the market by the use of products from intervention stocks, it should be specified that this possibility is part of the normal implementation of the plan. Due to the sharp reduction in intervention products available in stock, it should be specified that it is sufficient for the foodstuffs obtained to contain an ingredient belonging to the same product group as the intervention product.\n(6) To respond more effectively to the needs of charitable organisations and expand the range of foodstuffs supplied, it has been laid down that products from intervention stocks may be incorporated into other products for the purposes of manufacturing foodstuffs. Due to the sharp reduction in the range of intervention products available in stock, the obligation to maintain a minimum content of intervention product in the final product should be rescinded.\n(7) Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 provides for the possibility of mobilising on the market a product belonging to the same group as the product temporarily unavailable in the intervention stocks. Under the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 4(2)(a) of the abovementioned Regulation, processed agricultural products or foodstuffs may be obtained by supplying for payment products belonging to the same group of products from intervention stocks. These possibilities should be included in the rules on the processing of intervention products laid down in Article 4(2a) of that Regulation. At the same time, and in the interests of clarity, the structure of Article 4(1) should also be amended.\n(8) To clarify the application of the provisions concerning the release of securities in the event of failure to comply with the second requirement, the rules on the application of reductions, in accordance with Article 23(2)(a) and the third indent of Article 23(2)(b) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products\u00a0(3), should be defined.\n(9) Under the second subparagraph of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, the Member States are required to send the Commission the models of the invitations to tender before the commencement of the plan implementation period. This requirement unnecessarily complicates the management of the scheme and should be abolished.\n(10) As a result of changes to the wording of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 certain references to that paragraph should be changed in order to ensure clarity.\n(11) Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 lays down the procedures to be followed in the event of transfers. Since transfers require close cooperation between the Member State of destination and the supplier Member State, the supplier Member State should facilitate the operations in question as far as possible so that the time limits laid down in Article 3(2) of that Regulation can be met and that operations can be carried out in accordance with Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) of intervention measures in the form of public storage operations and the accounting of public storage operations by the paying agencies of the Member States\u00a0(4). In that context, it should be specified that a removal order issued by the intervention agency of the Member State of destination is the document required for placing the products at the disposal of the supply contractor by the intervention agency of the supplier Member State. Furthermore, in order to ensure that withdrawal from stocks is controlled, it should be laid down that the intervention agency of the supplier Member State must inform the competent authority of the Member State of destination of the end of the operation to withdraw products from intervention stocks.\n(12) Article 8a of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 specifying rules for payment does not cover cases of incomplete payment requests. Rules and penalties to be applied in such cases should be laid down. Provision should also be made for Community measures to be taken in the event of late payment.\n(13) Experience has shown that European Union citizens are not sufficiently aware of the role played by the Community in food aid for disadvantaged sections of the population. As a result, it should be laid down that the European Union flag must appear on the packaging.\n(14) The stages of the distribution chain to which the checks provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 9(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 apply should be more precisely stipulated. The penalties to be applied in the event of shortcomings or irregularities by the various bodies involved in distribution should also be specified.\n(15) Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 should be amended accordingly.\n(16) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,", "main_body": ["Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

Their number is invariable.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulation colours\nThe emblem is in the following colours: PANTONE REFLEX BLUE for the surface of the rectangle; PANTONE YELLOW for the stars. The international PANTONE range is very widely available and easily accessible even for non-professionals.\nFour-colour reproduction process: If the four-colour process is used, it is not possible to use the two standard colours. It is therefore necessary to recreate them by using the four colours of the four-colour process. PANTONE YELLOW is obtained by using 100\u00a0% \u201cProcess Yellow\u201d. By mixing 100\u00a0% \u201cProcess Cyan\u201d and 80\u00a0% \u201cProcess Magenta\u201d one can get a colour very similar to PANTONE REFLEX BLUE.\nMonochrome reproduction process: If only black is available, outline the rectangle in black and print the stars in black and white. In the event that blue is the only colour available (it must be Reflex Blue, of course), use it 100\u00a0% with the stars reproduced in negative white and the field 100\u00a0% blue.\nReproduction on coloured background: It is preferable for the emblem to be reproduced on a white background. Avoid a background of varied colours, and in any case one which does not go with blue. If there should be no alternative to a coloured background, put a white border around the rectangle, with the width of this being equal to one twenty-fifth of the height of the rectangle.\u2019", "eurovoc_concepts": ["2735", "4284", "807", "826", "862"]}

The virus can also persist in a contaminated environment outside the host animal for several weeks depending on the temperature.\n(5) The presence of foot-and-mouth disease in Algeria, Libya and Tunisia is liable to constitute a serious risk to the livestock population of the Union.\n(6) Although foot-and-mouth disease has not been confirmed in Morocco, that third country is a potential country of transit for the livestock vehicles returning from Algeria, Libya and Tunisia to the Union.\n(7) The drastic deterioration of the foot-and-mouth disease situation in Libya and its spread to and within Tunisia and Algeria require to adopt certain protection measures at the Union level which take into account the survival of the foot-and-mouth disease virus in the environment and potential transmission routes of that virus.\n(8) Livestock vehicles and vessels used for the transport of live animals to Algeria, Libya or Tunisia may be contaminated with the foot-and-mouth disease virus in those infected countries and therefore constitute a risk of introducing the disease upon their return to the Union.\n(9) Appropriate cleansing and disinfection of livestock vehicles and vessels is the most appropriate way to reduce the risk of rapid virus transmission over large distances.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to ensure that all livestock vehicles and vessels which have transported live animals to destinations in Algeria, Libya or Tunisia are appropriately cleansed and disinfected and that such cleansing and disinfection is properly documented in the declaration submitted by the operator or driver to the competent authority at the point of entry.\n(11) The operator or driver should ensure that for each livestock vehicle and vessel a cleansing and disinfection certificate is retained for a minimum period of three years.\n(12) Member States should have the possibility to subject vehicles which transport feed from or have transported feed to infected countries and for which a significant risk of introduction of foot-and-mouth disease into the territory of the Union cannot be excluded to on-the-spot disinfection of the wheels or any other part of the vehicle deemed necessary to mitigate that risk.\n(13) In addition, although imports of live animals of species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease are not authorised from any country in Africa, the importation of certain categories of equidae is authorised from Algeria, Libya and Tunisia in accordance with Council Directive 2009/156/EC\u00a0(3) and equidae from those third countries may transit the Union on their way to another third country in accordance with Commission Decision 2010/57/EU\u00a0(4). Therefore, Member States should have the possibility to subject livestock vehicles carrying equidae coming from those third countries to on-the-spot disinfection of the wheels or any other part of the vehicle deemed necessary to mitigate the risk of introduction of foot-and-mouth disease into the Union.\n(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["For the purpose of this Decision, \u2018livestock vehicle\u2019 or \u2018livestock vessel\u2019 means any vehicle or vessel being used or which has been used for the transport of live terrestrial animals.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall ensure that the operator or driver of a livestock vehicle or livestock vessel on arrival from Algeria, Morocco, Libya or Tunisia provides to the competent authority of the Member State at the point of entry in the Union information showing that the livestock or loading compartment, where applicable the truck body, the loading ramp, the equipment having been in contact with animals, the wheels and the driver's cabin and protective clothes/boots used during unloading have been cleansed and disinfected after the last unloading of animals.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be included in a declaration completed in accordance with the model set out in Annex I or in any other equivalent format which includes at least the information set out in that model.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original of the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 shall be kept by the competent authority for a period of three years.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority of the Member State of the point of entry into the Union shall visually check livestock vehicles coming from Algeria, Libya, Morocco or Tunisia in order to determine whether they have been satisfactorily cleansed and disinfected.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The competent authority responsible for the issuing of the animal health certificate for imports into Algeria, Libya, Morocco or Tunisia of live animals to be loaded shall visually check livestock vessels in order to determine whether they have been satisfactorily cleansed and disinfected prior to loading the animals.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the checks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 show that cleansing and disinfection have been satisfactorily carried out or where the competent authorities have in addition to the measures provided for in paragraph 1 ordered, organised and carried out additional disinfection of previously cleansed livestock vehicles or vessels, the competent authority shall attest that fact by issuing a certificate in accordance with the model set out in Annex II.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the checks referred to in paragraph 1 and 2 show that cleansing and disinfection of the livestock vehicle or vessel have not been satisfactorily carried out, the competent authority shall take one of the following measures:\n(a) subject the livestock vehicle or vessel to proper cleansing and disinfection at a place designated by the competent authority, as close as possible to the point of entry into the Member State concerned and issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 3;\n(b) where there is no suitable facility for the cleansing and disinfection in the vicinity of the point of entry or where there is a risk that residual animal products may escape from the uncleansed livestock vehicle or vessel:\n(i) refuse the entry into the Union of the livestock vehicle or vessel; or\n(ii) perform a preliminary on-the-spot disinfection of the livestock vehicle or vessel not satisfactorily cleansed and disinfected pending the application of the measures provided for in point (a).\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original of the certificate referred to in paragraph 3 shall be kept by the operator or driver of the livestock vehicle for a period of three years.
