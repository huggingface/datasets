The company concerned cannot currently benefit from Eastman's 0 % duty rate because it uses the name \"Voridian Company\", in the documents issued for the purpose of its exports of the product to the Community, thus the fact that it belongs to Eastman remaining undisclosed. Eastman is, however, the only legal entity producing the product for export to the Community, whereas \"Voridian company\" is merely an unincorporated division of it. Eastman therefore requested the Commission to change the name under which it is mentioned in the Regulation to \"Voridian Company, a Division of Eastman Chemical Co\".\n(3) The Commission reviewed all the information supplied, which satisfactorily demonstrates that all Eastman's activities linked to the manufacturing, sales and exports of the product have in fact remained unchanged since the outset of the investigation and that the requested change can be considered as a mere adaptation to an organisational set-up, which occurred after the period covered for the purpose of the investigation of dumping.\n(4) Consequently, the Regulation should be amended, with effect from its date of entry into force, by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual rates,", "main_body": ["Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.

Based on the ultimate responsibility of the administrative, management or supervisory body for compliance as set out in Article 40 of Directive 2009/138/EC, its involvement in the decision-making process on the application should be carefully considered.\n(4) In addition to Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, that Directive contains other requirements in Article 44, 45 and 77c which apply to all insurance or reinsurance undertakings using a matching adjustment. An application should therefore include evidence that all of these requirements will be satisfied if approval is granted.\n(5) The procedures to be followed for the approval of the matching adjustment envisage ongoing communication between the supervisory authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings. This includes communication before a formal application is submitted to the supervisory authorities and, after an application has been approved, through the supervisory review process. Such ongoing communication is necessary to ensure that supervisory judgements are based on relevant and up-to-date information and evidence.\n(6) To ensure a smooth and efficient process, supervisory authorities should be able to request that insurance and reinsurance undertakings make modifications to an application in order to address areas where the submitted evidence is insufficient to demonstrate compliance with the relevant conditions set by Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/EC, before deciding whether to finally accept or reject the application.\n(7) In addition to considering the evidence included within an application, supervisory authorities should also consider other factors that are relevant when reaching a decision as to whether the requirements of Directive 2009/138/EC have been satisfied.\n(8) Since matching portfolios may be managed on a going concern basis, undertakings that have received approval to use a matching adjustment to value the corresponding liabilities should also be allowed to use that adjustment to value future insurance obligations, to the extent that those obligations and the assets matching them possess the same features as the obligations and assets included in the initial matching portfolio and, consequently, entail the same risks for the undertaking concerned.\n(9) Due to interdependencies between different approval applications under Directive 2009/138/EC, when applying for approval of matching adjustment the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should inform the supervisory authority of other applications concerning items in Article 308a(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC, which are currently ongoing or foreseen within the next six months. Such requirement is necessary to ensure supervisory assessments are based on transparent and unbiased information.\n(10) This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority to the European Commission.\n(11) The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council\u00a0(2),\n(12) In order to enhance legal certainty about the supervisory regime during the phasing-in period provided for in Article 308a of Directive 2009/138/EC, which will start on 1 April 2015, it is important to ensure that this Regulation enters into force as soon as possible, on the day after that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.", "main_body": ["Application to use a matching adjustment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insurance and reinsurance undertakings applying to use a matching adjustment shall submit a written application for prior approval to the supervisory authorities.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The application shall be submitted in one of the official languages of the Member State in which the insurance or reinsurance undertaking has its head office, or in a language previously agreed by the supervisory authority, and shall contain at least the information required by Articles 3 to 6 of this Regulation.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insurance and reinsurance undertakings shall ensure that the application includes any other relevant information that they consider may be necessary for the assessment and decision by the supervisory authority.

Based on the characteristics of this programme, the emphasis is on delegating technical tasks, the main aim being to strengthen the connections between the said Community programme and communities of experts in the Member States.\n(6) The agency will have to mobilise high-level expertise in order to meet the objectives defined by the Commission and under its control. The agency will also have to make it possible to optimise the implementation of the programme by facilitating the recruitment of specialists in public health matters.\n(7) In addition to its tasks in the long term, the agency will improve flexibility in the implementation of the programme. The agency's annual work programme will ensure that it supports the setting of annual priorities for the implementation of the public health programme, arranged and decided by the Commission following the opinion of the programme committee.\n(8) Management based on the results obtained by the agency, together with the establishment of the necessary procedures and channels of control and coordination, will make it possible to simplify the ways in which the programme is implemented by the Commission. The Commission will be able to capitalise on the technical work carried out by the agency, by developing, in parallel and in an appropriate manner, tasks which require political discretion. The Commission will also develop tasks relating to the implementation of the programme which it would be inappropriate to entrust to the agency.\n(9) Cooperation between the agency and the Commission, and the accomplishment of the agency's specific tasks as regards disseminating information and providing assistance to networks, should help to raise the profile of Community action in the field of public health.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,", "main_body": ["Article 1\nEstablishment\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An executive agency for the management of the Community programme in the field of public health (the Agency), the statute of which is laid down in Regulation (EC) No 58/2003, is hereby established.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name of the Agency shall be the \u2018Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme\u2019.", "Location\nThe Agency shall be located in Luxembourg.", "Term\nThe Agency is hereby established for a period beginning on 1 January 2005 and ending on 31 December 2010.", "Objectives and tasks\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Community programme in the field of public health established by Decision No 1786/2002/EC (framework Decision), the Agency is hereby entrusted with implementing the tasks concerning Community aid under the programme, except for programme evaluation, monitoring of legislation, or any other action which could come under the exclusive competence of the Commission.

That list included carbetamide.\n(2) In accordance with Article 11e of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances\u00a0(4) was adopted on the non-inclusion of carbetamide.\n(3) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter \u2018the applicant\u2019) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I\u00a0(5).\n(4) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n(5) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter \u2018the Authority\u2019) and to the Commission on 12 February 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on carbetamide to the Commission on 22 November 2010\u00a0(6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 March 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for carbetamide.\n(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing carbetamide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include carbetamide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n(8) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing carbetamide to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n(9) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market\u00a0(7) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n(11) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of carbetamide and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning carbetamide in the Annex to that Decision.\n(12) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.\n(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,", "main_body": ["Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.", "The line concerning carbetamide in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC is deleted.", "Member States shall adopt and publish by 30 November 2011 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.\n(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.\n(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.\n(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC\u00a0(3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\n(5) Hungary notified the Commission of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5 in a holding on its territory where poultry or other captive birds are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones.\n(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Hungary, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holding where the outbreak was confirmed.\n(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly define the protection and surveillance zones established in Hungary at Union level in collaboration with that Member State.\n(8) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, the protection and surveillance zones in Hungary, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.\n(9) This Decision is to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,", "main_body": ["Hungary shall ensure that the protection and surveillance zones established in accordance with Article 16(1) of Directive 2005/94/EC comprise at least the areas listed as protection and surveillance zones in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.", "This Decision shall apply until 26 March 2015.", "This Decision is addressed to Hungary."], "attachments": "Done at Brussels, 27 February 2015.\nFor the Commission\nVytenis ANDRIUKAITIS\nMember of the Commission\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0395, 30.12.1989, p.\u00a013.\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0OJ L\u00a0224, 18.8.1990, p.\u00a029.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (OJ L\u00a010, 14.1.2006, p.\u00a016).\nANNEX\nPART A\nProtection zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name\nHU Hungary Postal Area comprising:\nIn the county of B\u00e9k\u00e9s:\n5525 F\u00fczesgyarmat\nPART B\nSurveillance zone as referred to in Article 1:\nISO Country Code Member State Code Name\nHU Hungary Postal code Area comprising:\nIn the county of B\u00e9k\u00e9s:\n5526 Kert\u00e9szsziget\n5527 Bucsa\n5520 Szeghalom\n5510 D\u00e9vav\u00e1nya\nIn the county of Hajd\u00fa-Bihar:\n4173 Nagyr\u00e1b\u00e9\n4145 Cs\u00f6km\u0151\n4144 Darvas\n4171 S\u00e1rretudvari\n4172 Biharnagybajom\n4163 Szerep", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1445", "4743", "7879", "8464"]}

The European Union reiterates the great importance it attaches to the political dialogue, provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, and officially launched at the request of the Government of Zimbabwe at the EU-Zimbabwe Ministerial Troika on 18-19 June 2009 in Brussels. At the most recent Ministerial Meeting of 2 July 2010, an inclusive Zimbabwean Delegation headed by Minister Mangoma, handed over an updated version of the GPA Commitment Plan. The European Union took note of the progress made so far in the implementation of the GPA and informed the Government of Zimbabwe by letter dated 29 September 2010 of the 10th EDF indicative allocation (EUR\u00a0130 million to become available upon lifting of Article 96 and signing of a Country Strategy Paper). The European Union remains committed to further intensifying the Article 8 political dialogue.\nThe European Union supports the ongoing efforts of the GNU to implement the GPA, and welcomes the achievements made in stabilising the economy and restoring basic social services. However, the European Union regrets the lack of progress on key political agreements of the GPA.\nThe European Union encourages all parties forming the GNU to remain committed to the implementation of the democratic reforms as set out in the GPA. The European Union considers progress in this area, such as an understanding between all parties to the GNU on concrete steps towards creating an environment for peaceful and credible elections, to be of great importance.\nIn this context, the European Union welcomes intensified regional diplomacy and the efforts of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and its Member States to create an environment conducive to elections.\nIn light of the above, the European Union has decided to extend until 20 February 2012 the period of application of the appropriate measures set out in Council Decision 2002/148/EC and adapted in Council Decision 2010/97/CFSP. The European Union would like to assure Zimbabwe of its continued willingness to engage itself and to review at any time the restrictions on development cooperation. We would hope that concrete progress on the ground could be made to allow for full cooperation to resume. In this context, the European Union will closely follow the steps made by the Government of Zimbabwe towards ensuring credible elections.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the European Union", "eurovoc_concepts": ["381", "4048", "4730", "4782", "5083", "5622", "584", "862", "922"]}

Background\nA. Commission Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC(3)\n(1) By its decision to open the procedure provided for pursuant to the former Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty and Article 6(4) of Commission Decision 3855/91/ECSC(4) regarding certain measures granted in favour of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola de Tubos por Extrusi\u00f3n SA (hereinafter \"Tubacex\") and its steel-making subsidiary, Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava(5), the Commission expressed its doubts whether the repayment agreements between these companies and the wages fund Fogasa and the rescheduling agreement between these companies and the Social Security Fund, among other measures, constituted compatible State aid within the meaning of the former Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 1 of Decision 3855/91/ECSC.\n(2) By its Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC the Commission came to the conclusion that the these measures, itemised below, were not consistent with prevailing market conditions in so far as the rate of interest were below market rates. Accordingly, the Decision stated that these measures were incompatible with the common market:\n(a) the 10 July 1992 loan agreement between the wage guarantee fund (Fogasa), Tubacex and Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava covering ESP 444327300 in principal, as amended by agreements of 8 February 1993 and 16 February 1994 (covering in principal ESP 376194872 and ESP 372000000 respectively);\n(b) the 10 March 1994 loan agreement between Fogasa, Tubacex and Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava covering ESP 465727750 in principal, as amended by the agreement of 3 October 1994 covering ESP 469491521 in principal;\n(c) the agreement of 25 March 1994 between the Social Security Treasury and Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava to reschedule debts amounting to ESP 274409604;\n(d) the agreement of 12 April 1994 between the Social Security Treasury and Tubacex to reschedule debts amounting to ESP 1409957329.\nB. The judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 29 April 1999 in case C-342/96, Spain v Commission(6) relating to State aid granted by Spain to Tubacex\n(3) Following an application by Spain, the Court of Justice delivered its judgment in the abovementioned case, annulling Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC, which had declared as incompatible aid to Tubacex the rescheduling agreements between Tubacex and the Social Security Treasury and the repayment agreements between Tubacex and the Fogasa, in so far as the rate of interest was below market rates.\n(4) In its ruling case the Court concluded that Fogasa does not award loans to undertakings in liquidation or in difficulties, but settles all valid claims put forward by employees with money which it pays and then recovers from the undertakings. Moreover, Fogasa may conclude repayment agreements enabling it to reschedule the sums payable or to make them payable by instalments.\n(5) Similarly, the Social Security Fund may agree to rescheduling the payment of debts in respect of social security contributions or to their payment by instalments.\n(6) The Court noted that in these repayment and rescheduling agreements, the State did not act as a public investor whose conduct must be compared to the conduct of a private investor laying out capital with a view to realising a profit but as a public creditor which, like private creditor, seeks to recover sums due to it.\n(7) The interest normally applicable to that type of debt is intended to make good the loss suffered by the creditor because of the debtor's delay in performing its obligation to pay off its debt, namely default interest. If the rate of default interest applied to the debts of a public creditor is lower than the rate charged for the debts owed to a private creditor, it is the latter rate which ought to be charged.\n(8) Based on the above arguments, the Court annulled Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC to the extent that it declared the measures granted in favour of Tubacex to be incompatible with the EC Treaty. (Since the decision as regards incompatibility of the measures with the Steel Aids Code (to the extent that these measures also benefited Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava) had not been challenged, the Court did not annul that part of the Decision).\nII. Procedure\n(9) Having examined the Court judgment, the Commission decided to (re-)open the proceedings that had preceded the annulled decision.\n(10) The Commission informed the Spanish Government of its decision by letter dated 16 February 2000 (SG(2000) D/101515).\n(11) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(7). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the re-analysis of the measures in the light of the Court judgment and, consequently, on the envisaged partial revocation of its Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC.\nIII. Comments from interested parties\n(12) No comments were submitted by interested parties.\nIV. Comments from Spain\n(13) By letter dated 20 March 2000, the Spanish Government replied to the Commission's letter opening the procedure. The main points were as follows.\n(14) The Spanish authorities disagreed with the decision of the Commission to open the formal investigation procedure inasmuch in their view the investigation procedure was not necessary to carry out the envisaged partial revocation of Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC.\n(15) As regards the rescheduling agreements between the companies and the Social Security Treasury, the Spanish authorities did not support the view of the Commission that \"it seems probable that, in the case of out-of-court agreements concerned with or having the effect of rescheduling pre-existing debts, the logic of the creditor's behaviour would lead him to seek to obtain from the debtor a rate of interest on arrears that would be higher than the legal interest rate as compensation for not pursuing the recovery of the debt by legal means\". On the contrary, they claimed that, due to the financial situation of the company as well as costs, delay and uncertainty involved in legal proceedings, out-of-court agreements would frequently lead to agree an interest rate lower than the legal interest rate.\n(16) Thus, the Spanish authorities reiterated their argument that the granting of deferments applying the legal interest rate protects the interests of the social security system, in terms of recovering debts, better than any other form of action that a private creditor could have taken.\n(17) Moreover, the Spanish Government recalled that while a private creditor can agree any interest rate with the debtor, the Social Security authorities are bound by Article 20 of Social Security General Law(8) which lays down that the legal interest rate is to be applied in the rescheduling agreements of debt.\n(18) The Commission noted in the opening decision that the comparison of the terms contained in the private creditors' agreement in October 1993 and the terms of the rescheduling agreement between the Social Security authorities and the companies may not constitute a correct application of the \"private creditor\" test as defined by the Court. In this respect, the Spanish authorities stated that due to legal constrains of public administration, circumstances of public creditors cannot be similar to those of private creditors indeed. However, they emphasised that despite the different circumstances, the agreements between the Social Security authorities/Fogasa and the companies were not more favourable than those reached in the private creditors' agreement, on the contrary they were much less generous.\n(19) Finally, the Spanish authorities reiterated the views expressed under the procedure which led to Decision 97/21/ECSC,EC and in their submissions to the Court.\nV. Assessment\n(20) It should be recalled that although the Court of Justice annulled only those parts of Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC relating to the measures granted to Tubacex, the Commission considers that the Court's analysis of the measures granted in favour of Tubacex in relation to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty is fully applicable to the ECSC part of Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC in respect of the measures granted in favour of Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava. In order to safeguard the rights of Spain and all other interested parties, the Commission therefore signalled in its (re-)opening of the investigation proceedings that it would re-examine that part of the previous decision with a view to partially revoking it and to adopt a new decision on the basis of this re-assessment. The comments received under the procedure confirm that this approach is appropriate.\n(21) The Commission must consider whether or not any of the elements deemed as incompatible with the common market set out in Article 1 of Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 4(c) of the ECSC Treaty. If any such aid were found to exist, the Commission would then need to consider whether it was compatible with the common market.\n(22) It should firstly be noted that the companies were already subject to the pre-existing statutory obligation to repay the wages advanced by Fogasa and to pay their debts in respect of social security contributions. The agreements in question did not therefore create any new debt owed by the companies to the public authorities. Thus, in the repayment agreements of Fogasa and in the rescheduling agreements of Social Security Fund, the State did not act as a public investor whose conduct must be compared to that of a private investor providing capital with a view to realising a profit but as a public creditor which, like a private creditor, may seek to recover sums due to it. Consequently, in assessing the contested State aid, the Commission has to compare the default rate of interest applied to the debts of the public creditor with the rate charged for the debts owed to private creditors acting in similar circumstances.\n(23) However it should be noted that particular circumstances of debtors and creditors are likely to prove problematic for the determination of a common applicable behaviour of private creditors seeking to recover sums due to them. Consequently, the Commission has to base its assessment on an analysis of the behaviour of private creditors on a case by case approach.\n(24) In this particular case the separate agreements between Fogasa and the companies and between Social Security and the companies did not accord the companies any more generous treatment than that reached in the private creditors' agreement reached in October 1993.\n(25) However, the circumstances of those private creditors were not the same as those of public creditors because of their status, the securities provided,, etc. Consequently, the Commission considers that such a comparative approach does not constitute in this particular case a correct application of the \"private creditors\" test as defined by the Court, which as it subsequently underlined in its judgment of 29 June 1999 in the DMT case (C-256/97)(9), supposes that the public creditors' behaviour under examination should be compared with that of a hypothetical private creditor finding himself, as far as possible, in the same situation.\n(26) The Commission notes that Article 1108 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that the legal interest rate is that one which applies for compensation of damage and harm when the debtor delays the payment and no determined interest rate has been agreed. In addition, Article 312 of the Spanish Commercial Law rules that in case of a loan in money and in the absence of any specific agreement between the parties, the debtor is obliged to repay the legal value (valor legal) of the debt at the time the repayment is done. Therefore, the legal interest rate would be the highest rate a private creditor could expect to obtain if he pursues the recovery of the debt by legal means.\n(27) As a consequence, a private creditor could not have obtained from the debtor a rate of interest on arrears that would be higher than the legal interest rate as a compensation for not pursuing the recovery of the debt by legal means.\n(28) Finally, the particular circumstances of the companies at the time the rescheduling agreements with Fogasa and the Social Security Fund were made should be underlined. They had been in serious financial difficulties, resulting in the suspension of all debt repayments and serious doubts about their future existence. By not proceeding to execution and thereby possibly provoking the liquidation of the company, the public creditors acted in such a way as to maximise the prospects of recovering the debt.\n(29) In the light of the above, the Commission can accept that in this particular case, by rescheduling and applying the legal interest rate to debts owed by the companies, Spain was seeking to maximise the recovery of the sums due to it without suffering any financial loss. Consequently, Spain acted as a hypothetical private creditor, which is in the same position vis-a-vis the companies, would have acted.\nConclusion\n(30) In the light of the above, the re-assessment of the alleged aid deemed as incompatible with the common market by Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC leads to the conclusion that the repayment agreements between Fogasa and Tubacex and the debt rescheduling agreements between Social Security and Tubacex do not constitute State aid. The re-assessment leads to the same conclusion in relation to the agreements with Acer\u00eda de \u00c1lava.\n(31) Consequently, the Commission considers that it should amend its Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC accordingly.", "main_body": ["Decision 97/21/ECSC, EC is amended as follows:\n1.

Under this agreement, the participating firms, which produce molten steel by the electric furnace method, have formed a company called \"Consorzio Italiano dei Minerali Preridotti SpA (COIMPRE)\" with a capital of Lit 72 000 000 and a registered office in Rome.\n3. COIMPRE's main objects are to:      - prepare studies and proposals with a view to stimulating the consumption of prereduced iron ore and thereby limiting scrap consumption. In this context, COIMPRE will study ways of expanding the production of prereduced iron ore in Italy and of procuring prereduced material from other countries;\n- promote supply from other countries of prereduced ores to the member firms by spot purchases by the conclusion of long-term agreements or by participating financially in companies producing iron ore in other countries. Activities relating to supply will be entrusted to existing agencies or to others which will be set up for the purpose to work in liaison with COIMPRE;\n- promote the study and possibly the setting up in Italy of iron ore direct reduction plant. The studies and plans, their implementation and the operation of the plants will be entrusted to other existing companies or companies to be formed which will act in liaison with COIMPRE;\n- handle such contacts with European firms and organizations interested in prereduction as will be conducive to the attainment of the above objectives.\n4. The capital of COIMPRE is held as follows: >PIC FILE= \"T0010608\">\nNo member may hold more than 20 % of the capital.\n5. Unless extended beyond or terminated before the expiry date, COIMPRE will operate until 31 December 2025 ; it will be run by a board of directors consisting of not less than six or more than 12 members, appointed for three years ; minority members will be represented on the board by means of an appropriate system of election.\n6. COIMPRE is a non-profit-making association ; management costs will be met from contributions paid by the members in proportion to their shareholdings.\nII  7. The agreement restricts the normal play of competition between the undertakings involved in that they agree:      - to share products and sources of supply by coordinating their purchases of prereduced iron ore through COIMPRE ; and\n- to control investment in and production of prereduced iron ore through COIMPRE either alone or together with third parties.\n8. In these circumstances, the agreement is caught by the prohibition in Article 65 (1) of the Treaty.\n9. But Article 65 (2) stipulates that specialization agreements, joint-buying and joint-selling agreements and agreements which are strictly analogous thereto may be authorized if the Commission finds that they satisfy all the tests of Article 65.\n10. The supply agreement between the participating companies in respect of prereduced ore to be procured through COIMPRE or other agencies acting in liaison with COIMPRE is a joint-buying agreement.\n11. The agreement can therefore be authorized under Article 65 (2), if and so far as it makes for a substantial improvement in production or distribution, if it is essential in order to achieve these results and if it is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose ; the agreement must also be not liable to give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices or to control or to restrict the production or marketing of a substantial part of the products in question within the common market, or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings within the common market.\nIII    12. Prereduced iron ore is the product of direct reduction of iron ore by various processes, using mainly oil and natural gas as the reducing agent ; prereduction offers special advantages to countries which do not have the coal required for fuelling blast furnaces.\n13. Prereduced iron ore is high quality material which can be used as a substitute for scrap in all steel manufacturing processes ; because of its low copper and tin content, it can be used in electric furnaces to produce high quality steels.\n14. Scrap-consuming steelmaking processes are either gaining popularity, as in the case of electric steels, or are declining less rapidly, as in the case of open hearth steels. At the same time, more and more steelworks are adopting the continuous casting process, which produces less scrap.\nThis means that, despite the present economic situation, the balance between scrap supply and demand is likely to deteriorate in the medium and long term.\n15. World production of prereduced iron ore stands at some 7 000 000 tonnes a year, of which almost 500 000 tonnes is produced in the Community. World production is expected to be around 20 000 000 tonnes in 1980, with about 3 000 000 tonnes produced in the Community.\n16. In 1975 the COIMPRE member firms produced 3 600 000 tonnes of electric-furnace steel, which represents 38 74 % of aggregate Italian production of this type of steel and 16 75 % of Italian crude steel production.\n17. Italy is the Community's biggest producer of electric steel, supplying 38 77 % of all production in 1975. With 5 600 000 tonnes of scrap imported in 1973, she is also the Community's biggest importer of scrap, and is expected to import 7 500 000 tonnes in 1985. Since it is the most vulnerable to any disruption of the world scrap market, Italy's steel industry could find that prereduced ore will help to stabilize its supply.\nIV    18. The joint-buying of ore through COIMPRE will enable the member companies to obtain more advantageous prices and terms from producers and save money on carriage and supply ; through long-term agreements, they will be able to secure stable sources of supply.\n19. The joint-buying agreement will accordingly make for a substantial improvement in production by the members of COIMPRE.\n20. The same degree of improvement could not be attained if each of the firms were to obtain its prereduced ore individually. The agreement is therefore essential to achieve the desired results and is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose. It thus satisfies the tests of Article 65 (2) (1) (a) and (b) of the Treaty.\n21. The prices of prereduced ore are determined by supply and demand on the world market and by the prices of its chief substitutes, pig iron and scrap. Any quantity of prereduced ore which COIMPRE might buy on behalf of its members will not be sufficiently large to determine the level of ore prices. Joint-buying is therefore not liable to give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices or to control or to restrict the production or marketing of a substantial part of the products in question within the common market, or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings within the common market.\nV    22. As regards the provision in the agreement for COIMPRE to acquire shareholdings in foreign firms and to set up and operate direct ore reduction plants, the Commission cannot decide whether these arrangements are compatible with Articles 65 and 66 of the Treaty until the details and conditions of these operations have been clearly specified. COIMPRE must therefore submit to the Commission any proposals to buy into other companies that produce or market prereduced ore and any proposals to build and operate direct reduction plant in the Community. Proposals so notified may not be implemented until the Commission has approved them in accordance with Articles 65 and 66 in the Treaty.\nVI    23. The Commission must be in a position to follow the course of cooperation in the Community steel industry in respect of joint supply and joint production of prereduced iron ore. COIMPRE and its member firms must therefore promptly notify the Commission of any change in the number of COIMPRE's shareholders and any other change or addition to the agreement or to the articles of COIMPRE. No such changes or additions may take effect until the Commission has decided that they are compatible with Articles 65 and 66 of the Treaty.\n24. Subject to the conditions to be imposed, the agreement is compatible with Article 65 (2) of the Treaty and may therefore be authorized,", "main_body": ["The agreement entered into on 16 February 1977 between the following steel undertakings:\nAcciaierie Tubificio Rag.

The amended Annex V to the MARPOL Convention entered into force on 1 January 2013.\n(2) This new categorization of garbage is reflected in IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.644/Rev.1, providing a standard format for the advance notification form for waste delivery to port reception facilities\u00a0(3), as well as in IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.645/Rev.1, providing a standard format for the waste delivery receipt following a ship's use of port reception facilities\u00a0(4).\n(3) In the interest of consistency with IMO measures and in order to avoid uncertainty amongst port users and authorities, the table included in Annex II to Directive 2000/59/EC, which contains the different types and amounts of waste and cargo residues to be delivered or retained on board, should be adapted to the new categorisation of garbage of the amended Annex V to the MARPOL Convention.\n(4) In addition, in order to improve the regime established under Directive 2000/59/EC, which aims at reducing discharges of ship-generated waste and cargo residues into the sea, information on the types and quantities of ship-generated waste actually delivered to port reception facilities in the last port of delivery should be included in the table of Annex II.\n(5) The exact data on the types and amounts of the ship-generated waste and cargo residues delivered by a ship in the last port is essential for an accurate calculation of sufficient dedicated storage capacity on that ship. The calculation of sufficient storage capacity is a prerequisite for allowing the ship to proceed to the next port of call without having delivered its ship-generated waste, as well as for a proper selection of vessels for inspection. Better targeted inspections will contribute to the effective operation of maritime traffic, by reducing turnaround time in ports.\n(6) This information may be available through waste receipts issued on basis of the IMO Circular MEPC.1/Circ.645/Rev.1, which recommends the standard format for the waste delivery receipt, or through other types of receipts issued to the master of the ship upon delivery of the waste. The amounts and types of waste indicated on the waste receipt or as declared by the master of the ship upon delivery in case a waste receipt cannot be obtained, would generally be more accurate than those available from the waste notification form, as they should reflect the actual situation after delivery and as such provide more reliability in the decision making process. The master of the ship records such delivery information in the Garbage Record Book as required by the MARPOL Convention.\n(7) A systematic collection of accurate data on waste delivery would also allow a better statistical analysis of waste flow patterns in ports and facilitate the establishment of the information and monitoring system foreseen in Article 12(3) of Directive 2000/59/EC. The monitoring and exchange of such information, including the electronic waste notification developed under Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(5), are currently supported by the Union maritime information and exchange system (SafeSeaNet), established by Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(6), which should be linked to a reporting module within the Port State Control database\u00a0(7) set up under Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and the Council\u00a0(8).\n(8) Annex II to Directive 2000/59/EC should be amended to include the information on waste delivery in the previous port and in order to incorporate the new categorization of garbage introduced by the amended MARPOL Annex V.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,", "main_body": ["Annex II to Directive 2000/59/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Directive.", "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 9 December 2016 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Purpose and scope\nThe method is for the determination of spiramycin in feedingstuffs and premixes. The lower limit of determination is 1 mg/kg (1 ppm) [1]\n2. Principle\nThe sample is extracted with a mixture of methanol/phosphate-bicarbonate buffer at pH 8. The extract is decanted or centrifuged and diluted. Its antibiotic activity is determined by measuring the diffusion of spiramycin in an agar medium inoculated with Micrococcus luteus. Diffusion is shown by the formation of zones of inhibition of the micro-organism. The diameter of these zones is taken to be in direct proportion to the logarithm of the antibiotic concentration over the range of antibiotic concentrations employed.\n3. Micro-organism : Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 (NCTC 8340, NCIB 8553)\n3.1. Maintenance of stack culture\nInoculate tubes containing slopes of culture medium (4.1) with Micrococcus luteus and incubate for 24 hours at 30 o C. Store the culture in a refrigerator at about 4 o C. Reinoculate every two weeks.\n3.2. Preparation of the bacterial suspension [2]\nHarvest the growth from a recently prepared agar slope (3.1) with 2 to 3 ml of sodium chloride solution (4.3). Use this suspension to inoculate 250 ml of culture medium (4.1) contained in a Roux flask and incubate for 18 to 20 hours at 30 oC. Harvest the growth in 25 ml of sodium chloride solution (43) and mix. Dilute the suspension to 1/10 with sodium chloride solution (4.3). The light transmission of the suspension must be about 75 %, measured at 650 nm in a 1 cm cell against sodium chloride solution (4.3). This suspension may be kept for one week at about 4 oC.\n4. Culture media and reagents\n4.1. Culture medium [3]\nMeat peptone | 6,0 g |\nTryptone | 4,0 g |\nYeast extract | 3,0 g |\nMeat extract | 1,5 g |\nGlucose | 1,0 g |\nAgar | 10,0 to 20,0 g |\nWater | 1000 ml |\npH 6,5 to 6,6 (after sterilization). | |\n4.2.

Sodium chloride solution 0,8 % (w/v)\nDissolve 8 g of sodium chloride in water and dilute to 1000 ml; sterilize.\n4.4. Phosphate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 8,0\nDipotassium hydrogen phosphate K2HPO4 | 16,7 g |\nPotassium dihydrogen phosphate KH2PO4 | 0,5 g |\nSodium hydrogen carbonate NaHCO3 | 20,0 g |\nWater to | 1000 ml |\n4.5. Mixture of methanol phosphate-bicarbonate buffer (4.4)\n50/50 (v/v).\n4.6 Standard substance\nSpiramycin of known activity (in IU).\n5. Standard solutions\nDissolve an accurately weighed quantity of the standard substance (4.6) in the mixture (4.5) and dilute with the same mixture to give a stock solution containing 1000 IU spiramycin per millilitre. Stored in a stoppered flask at 4 o C this solution is stable for up to five days.\nFrom this stock solution prepare by successive dilution with the mixture (4.5) the following solutions :\nS8 | 1 | IU/ml |\nS4 | 0,5 | IU/ml |\nS2 | 0,25 | IU/ml |\nS1 | 0,125 | IU/ml |\n6. Preparation of the extract and assay solutions\n6.1. Extraction\nWeigh out a quantity of sample of 20,0 g in the case of feedingstuffs, of 1,0 to 20,0 g for premixes. Add 100 ml of the mixture (4.5) and shake for 30 minutes. Centrifuge or decant and dilute the supernatant solution with the mixture (4.5) to obtain an expected spiramycin in content of 1 IU/ml (= Ug).\nFor expected levels of spiramycin lower than 2,5 mg/kg of feedingstuff the extraction must be carried out as follows. Weigh out a quantity of sample of 20,0 g. Add 100 ml of the mixture (4.5) and shake for 30 minutes. Centrifuge for a few minutes, take 50 ml of the supernatant solution and evaporate to about 4 ml under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator at a temperature not exceeding 40 oC. Dilute the residue with the mixture (4.5) to obtain an expected spiramycin content of 1 IU/ml (= U8).\n6.2. Assay solutions\nFrom solution U8 prepare solutions U4 (expected content: 0,5 IU/ml), U2 (expected content: 0,25 IU/ml) and U1 (expected content: 0,125 IU/ml) by means of successive dilution (1 + 1) with the mixture (4.5).\n7. Assay procedure\n7.1. Inoculation of the assay medium\nInoculate the assay medium (4.2) with the bacterial suspension (3.2) at about 50 oC . By preliminary trials on plates with assay medium (4.2) determine the quantity of bacterial suspension required to give the largest and clearest zones of inhibition with the various concentrations of spiramycin.\n7.2. Preparation of the plates\nDiffusion through agar is carried out in plates with the four concentrations of the standard solution (S8, S4, S2, S1) and the four concentrations of the assay solution (U8, U4, U2, U1). These four concentrations of extract and standard must necessarily be placed in each plate. To this effect, select plates big enough to allow at least eight holes with a diameter of 10 to 13 mm and not less than 30 mm between centres to be made in the agar medium. The test may be carried out on plates consisting of a sheet of glass with a faced aluminium or plastic ring placed on top, 200 mm in diameter and 20 mm high.\nPour into the plates a quantity of the medium (4.2), inoculated as in 7.1, to give a layer about 2 mm thick (60 ml for a plate of 200 mm diameter). Allow to set in a level position, bore the holes and place in them exactly measured volumes of assay and standard solutions (between 0,10 and 0,15 ml per hole, according to the diameter). Apply each concentration at least four times so that each determination is subject to an evalution of 32 zones of inhibition.\n7.3. Incubation\nIncubate the plates for 16 to 18 hours at 30 \u00b1 2 oC.\n8. Evaluation\nMeasure the diameter of the zones of inhibition to the nearest 0,1 mm. Record the mean measurements for each concentration on semi-logarithmic graph paper showing the logarithm of the concentrations in relation to the diameters of the zones of inhibition. Plot the best fit lines of both the standard solution and the extract, for example as below.\nDetermine the \"best fit\" point for the standard highest level (SH) using the formula:\n(a) SL=7s1+4s2+s4-2s810\nDetermine the \"best fit\" point for the standard lowest level (SL) using the formula:\n(b) SH=7s8+4s4+s2-2s110\nSimilarly calculate the \"best fit\" points for the extract lowest level (UL) and the extract highest level (UH) by substituting u1, u2, u4 and u8 for s1, s2, s4 and s8 in the above formulae [4].\nRecord the calculated SL and SH values on the same graph paper and join them to give the \"best fit\" line for the standard solution. Similarly record UL and UH and join them to give the \"best fit\" line for the extract.\nIn the absence of any interference the lines should be parallel. For practical purposes the lines can be considered parallel if the values (SH \u2014 SL) and (UH \u2014 UL) do not differ by more than 10 % from their mean value.\nIf the lines are found to be non-parallel either u1 and s1 or u8 and s8 may be discarded and SL, SH, UL and UH calculated, using the alternative formulae, to give alternative \"best fit\" lines :\n(a') SL=5s1+2s2-s46 ou 5s2+2s4-s86\n(b') SH=5s4+2s2-s16 ou 5s8+2s4-s26\nand similarly for UL and UH. The same criteria of parallelism should be satisfied. The fact that the result has been calculated from three levels should be noted on the final report.\nWhen the lines are considered as being parallel, calculate the logarithm of the relative activity (log A) by means of one of the following formulae, depending upon whether three or four levels have been used for the assessment of parallelism.\nFor four levels\n(c) log. A =u1+u2+u4+u8-s1-s2-s4-s8\u00d7 0,602u4+u8+s4+s8-u1-u2-s1-s2\nFor three levels\n(d) log. A =u1+u2+u4-s1-s2-s4\u00d7 0,401u4+s4-u1-s1\nou\n(d') log. A =u2+u4+u8-s2-s4-s8\u00d7 0,401u8+s8-u2-s2\nActivity of sample extract = activity of relevant standard \u00d7 A\n(U8 = S8 \u00d7 A)\nIf the relative activity is found to be outside the range of 0,5 to 2,0, then repeat the assay making appropriate adjustments to the extract concentrations or, if this is not possible, to the standard solutions. When the relative activity cannot be brought into the required range, any result obtained must be considered as approximate and this should be noted on the final report.\nWhen the lines are considered as not being parallel, repeat the determination.

In addition, with a view to the findings regarding production provided for in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1164/89, the method used must allow checks to cover a sufficiently representative percentage of the areas under hemp so as to ensure that crops correspond to those provided for under the common organisation of the market in this product.

Purpose and scope\nThis method seeks to determine the \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of varieties of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) As appropriate, the method involves applying procedure A or B herein described.\nThe method is based on the quantitative determination of \u03949-THC by gas chromatography (GC) after extraction with a suitable solvent.\n1.1. Procedure A:\nProcedure A is used for checks on production as provided for in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.\nWhere the checks show, for a significant number of samples of a given variety, THC contents which exceed that laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 619/71, the Commission may, without prejudice to any other measures it might take, decide in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1308/70 to use procedure B for the variety concerned.\n1.2. Procedure B:\nProcedure B is used in cases as referred to in the second subparagraph of point 1.1 and for checking that the conditions laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 619/71 are fulfilled with a view to inclusion on the list of varieties of hemp eligible for aid from the 2001 to 2002 marketing year.\nApplications to include a variety of hemp on the list must be accompanied by a report giving the findings of analyses carried out using this method.\n2. Sampling\n2.1. Samples\n- Procedure A: In a standing crop of a given variety of hemp, take a 30 cm part of each plant containing at least one female inflorescence per plant selected. Sampling is to be carried out during the period running from 20 days after the start of flowering to 10 days after the end of flowering, during the day, following a systematic pattern to ensure that the sample is representative of the field but excluding the edges of the crop.\n- Procedure B: In a standing crop of a given variety of hemp, take the upper third of each plant selected. Sampling is to be carried out during the 10 days following the end of flowering, during the day, following the end of flowering, during the day, following a systematic pattern to ensure that the sample is representative of the field but excluding the edges of the crop. In the case of dioecious varieties, only female plants must be taken.\n2.2. Sample size:\n- Procedure A: the sample is to comprise parts of 50 plants per field.\n- Procedure B: the sample is to comprise parts of 200 plants per field.\nEach sample is to be placed in a fabric or paper bag, without crushing it, and sent to the laboratory for analysis.\nThe Member State may provide for a second sample to be collected for counteranalysis, if required, to be kept either by the producer or by the body responsible for the analysis.\n2.3. Drying and storage of the sample:\nDrying of the samples must begin as soon as possible and, in any case, within 48 hours using any method below 70 \u00b0C. Samples should be dried to a constant weight and to a moisture content of between 8 % and 13 %.\nAfter drying, store the samples without crushing them at below 25 \u00b0C in a dark place.\n3. Determination of THC content\n3.1. Preparation of the test sample\nRemove stems and seeds over 2 mm in size from the dried samples.\nGrind the dried samples to obtain a semi-fine powder (passing through a 1 mm mesh sieve).\nThe powder may be stored for 10 weeks at below 25 \u00b0C in a dark, dry place.\n3.2. Reagents and extraction solution\nReagents:\n- \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol, pure for chromatographic purposes,\n- Squalane, pure for chromatographic purposes, as an internal standard.\nExtraction solution:\n- 35 mg of squalane per 100 ml hexane.\n3.3. Extraction of \u03949-THC\nWeigh 100 mg of the powdered test sample, place in a centrifuge tube and add 5 ml of extraction solution containing the internal standard.\nPlace in an ultrasound bath and leave for 20 minutes. Centrifuge for five minutes at 3000 r.p.m. and then remove the supernatant THC solution. Inject the solution into the chromatograph and carry out a quantitative analysis.\n3.4. Gas chromatography\n(a) Apparatus:\n- gas chromatograph with a flame ionisation detector and a split/splitless injector,\n- column allowing good separation of cannabinoids, for example a glass capillary column 25 m long and 0,22 mm in diameter impregnated with a 5 % non-polar phenyl-methyl-siloxane phase.\n(b) Calibration ranges:\nAt least three points for procedure A and five points for procedure B, including points 0,04 and 0,50 mg/ml \u03949-THC in extraction solution.\n(c) Experimental conditions:\nThe following conditions are given as an example for the column referred to in (a):\n>TABLE>\n(d) Volume injected: 1 \u03bcl\n4. Findings\nThe findings are to be expressed to two decimal places in grams of \u03949-THC per 100 grams of analytical sample dried to constant weight. A tolerance of 0,03 g per 100 g applies.\n- Procedure A: one determination per test sample.\nHowever, where the result obtained is above the limit laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 619/71, a second determination must be carried out per analysis sample and the mean value of the two determinations will be taken as the result.\n- Procedure B: the result corresponds to the mean value of two determinations per test sample.\"", "eurovoc_concepts": ["1667", "5384", "797", "80"]}

The Committee is therefore of the opinion that at present, it is not appropriate to use NOGE as an additive in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs due to its tendency to migrate in this application.\n(8) The use and/or presence of NOGE components with more than two aromatic rings and their derivatives in plastic materials and articles, surface coatings and adhesives intended to come into contact with foodstuffs should be regulated through the establishment of a strict limit, which should, in practice, provisionally rule out their use as additives. This provisional limit should apply pending the submission of adequate data for a more complete scientific risk assessment, in accordance with Article 5(7) of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and the development of adequate methods for the determination of their levels in foodstuffs.\n(9) The use and/or presence of NOGE and BFDGE as starting substances for the preparation of special coatings used to cover the surfaces of very big containers should provisionally be allowed to continue, pending the submission of further technical data. The large volume/surface area ratio of these containers, their repeated use over their long lifetime which reduces migration, and their contact with foodstuffs at ambient temperature in the majority of the applications suggest that it is not necessary to set a migration limit for NOGE and BFDGE in such containers.\n(10) Member States which have not yet authorised the use and/or the presence of BADGE and/or BFDGE and/or NOGE in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs should be able to maintain their prohibition.\n(11) The use and/or presence of BADGE, BFDGE and NOGE in plastic materials and articles, surface coatings such as varnishes, lacquers and paints, as well as adhesives, should be regulated at Community level to avoid risks to human health and barriers to the free movement of goods.\n(12) Errors due to the presence of other chemical substances may occur during analysis. Validated methods of analysis are, therefore, necessary for correct verification of compliance with the restrictions set out in the Directive.\n(13) A transitional period should be provided for in respect of materials and articles which are brought into contact with foodstuffs before the deadline for implementation of this Directive.\n(14) This transitional period should also take into account the requirements of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(2), as amended by Commission Directive 2001/101/EC(3).\n(15) In view of the new technical requirements, Commission Directive 2001/61/EC of 8 August 2001 on the use of certain epoxy derivatives in materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(4) should be repealed for reasons of clarity.\n(16) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,", "main_body": ["1.

Accordingly, it is necessary to determine the first regions where the data to be processed in the VIS, including photographs and fingerprint data, shall be collected and transmitted to the VIS for all visa applications in the region concerned, during the first phases of the progressive implementation.\n(2) Article 48(4) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 provides for the determination of these regions based on the following criteria: the risk of illegal immigration, threats to the internal security of the Member States and the feasibility of collecting biometrics from all locations in this region.\n(3) The Commission has made an assessment for the different regions as defined in 2005 by the Member States\u2019 experts for the progressive implementation of the VIS, and taking into account, notably for the first criterion, elements such as the average visa refusal and entry refusal rates for each of the regions concerned, and, for the third criterion, the fact that consular presence or representation should be increased in certain regions in order to efficiently implement the VIS in these regions.\n(4) According to this assessment, the first region where the collection and transmission of visa data to the VIS should start for all visa applications should be North Africa.\n(5) The second region where the collection and transmission of visa data to the VIS should start for all visa applications should be the Near East, with the exception of the occupied Palestinian territory due to the serious technical difficulties that might be encountered in the equipping of the consular posts or offices concerned. At a later stage a decision should be adopted concerning the start of operations of the VIS in this territory.\n(6) The third region where the collection and transmission of visa data to the VIS should start for all visa applications should be the Gulf Region.\n(7) To avoid a gap when fighting illegal immigration and protecting internal security, the Schengen border crossing points should be designated as a separate region for the roll-out in order to cover the visa applications lodged at the external borders. Member States should endeavour to start collecting and transmitting the data to the VIS at the external border crossing points as soon as possible in order to avoid that the roll-out in the regions is circumvented by third country nationals of these regions, lodging their applications at the external borders.\n(8) The starting date of the operations in each of these regions is to be determined by the Commission pursuant to Article 48(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008.\n(9) For the determination of the further regions, subsequent decisions should be taken at a later stage on the basis of an additional and up-dated assessment of these other regions in accordance with the relevant criteria and the experience with the implementation in the first regions defined by this Decision.\n(10) In accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark did not take part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it nor subject to its application.
