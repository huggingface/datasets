### Dataset Summary

The 20 bAbI tasks are the first set of 20 tasks for testing text understanding and reasoning in the bAbI project. These tasks are designed to measure understanding in several ways:
whether a system is able to answer questions via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more. The tasks are designed to be prerequisites for any system that aims to be capable of conversing with a human. The aim is that each task tests a unique aspect of text and reasoning, and hence test different capabilities of learning models.
