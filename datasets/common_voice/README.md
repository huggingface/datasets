### Dataset Summary

The Common Voice dataset consists of a unique MP3 and corresponding text file. Many of the 9,283 recorded hours in the dataset also include demographic metadata like age, sex, and accent that can help train the accuracy of speech recognition engines.

The dataset currently consists of 7,335 validated hours in 60 languages, but were always adding more voices and languages. Take a look at our Languages page to request a language or start contributing.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

A typical data point comprises the path to the audio file, called path and its sentence. Additional fields include accent, age, client_id, up_votes down_votes, gender, locale and segment.

`
{'accent': 'netherlands', 'age': 'fourties', 'client_id': 'bbbcb732e0f422150c30ff3654bbab572e2a617da107bca22ff8b89ab2e4f124d03b6a92c48322862f60bd0179ae07baf0f9b4f9c4e11d581e0cec70f703ba54', 'down_votes': 0, 'gender': 'male', 'locale': 'nl', 'path': 'nl/clips/common_voice_nl_23522441.mp3', 'segment': "''", 'sentence': 'Ik vind dat een dubieuze procedure.', 'up_votes': 2, 'audio': {'path': `nl/clips/common_voice_nl_23522441.mp3', 'array': array([-0.00048828, -0.00018311, -0.00137329, ...,  0.00079346, 0.00091553,  0.00085449], dtype=float32), 'sampling_rate': 48000}
`

### Data Fields

client_id: An id for which client (voice) made the recording

path: The path to the audio file

audio: A dictionary containing the path to the downloaded audio file, the decoded audio array, and the sampling rate. Note that when accessing the audio column: `dataset[0]["audio"]` the audio file is automatically decoded and resampled to `dataset.features["audio"].sampling_rate`. Decoding and resampling of a large number of audio files might take a significant amount of time. Thus it is important to first query the sample index before the `"audio"` column, *i.e.* `dataset[0]["audio"]` should **always** be preferred over `dataset["audio"][0]`.

sentence: The sentence the user was prompted to speak

up_votes: How many upvotes the audio file has received from reviewers

down_votes: How many downvotes the audio file has received from reviewers

age: The age of the speaker.

gender: The gender of the speaker

accent: Accent of the speaker

locale: The locale of the speaker

segment: Usually empty field

### Data Splits

The speech material has been subdivided into portions for dev, train, test, validated, invalidated, reported and other.

The validated data is data that has been validated with reviewers and recieved upvotes that the data is of high quality.

The invalidated data is data has been invalidated by reviewers
and recieved downvotes that the data is of low quality.

The reported data is data that has been reported, for different reasons.

The other data is data that has not yet been reviewed.

The dev, test, train are all data that has been reviewed, deemed of high quality and split into dev, test and train.
