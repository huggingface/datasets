### Dataset Summary

This corpus is an attempt to recreate the dataset used for training XLM-R. This corpus comprises of monolingual data for 100+ languages and also includes data for romanized languages (indicated by *_rom). This was constructed using the urls and paragraph indices provided by the CC-Net repository by processing January-December 2018 Commoncrawl snapshots.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

CC-100 is mainly inteded to pretrain language models and word represantations.

### Languages

To load a language which isn't part of the config, all you need to do is specify the language code in the config.
You can find the valid languages in Homepage section of Dataset Description: https://data.statmt.org/cc-100/
E.g.

`dataset = load_dataset("cc100", lang="en")`

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example from the `am` configuration:

```
{'id': '0', 'text': 'ተለዋዋጭ የግድግዳ አንግል ሙቅ አንቀሳቅሷል ቲ-አሞሌ አጥቅሼ ...\n'}
```

Each data point is a paragraph of text. The paragraphs are presented in the original (unshuffled) order. Documents are separated by a data point consisting of a single newline character.

### Data Fields

The data fields are:

- id: id of the example
- text: content as a string

### Data Splits

Sizes of some configurations:

|   name   |train|
|----------|----:|
|am|3124561|
|sr|35747957|

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

[More Information Needed]

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

The data comes from multiple web pages in a large variety of languages.

### Annotations

The dataset does not contain any additional annotations.

#### Annotation process

[N/A]

#### Who are the annotators?

[N/A]

### Personal and Sensitive Information

Being constructed from Common Crawl, personal and sensitive information might be present. This **must** be considered before training deep learning models with CC-100, specially in the case of text-generation models.

## Considerations for Using the Data

We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +14.6{\%} average accuracy on XNLI, +13{\%} average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.4{\%} F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7{\%} in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4{\%} for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make our code and models publicly available.",

The quality of these models benefits greatly from the size of the pretraining corpora as long as its quality is preserved.

Our pipeline follows the data processing introduced in fastText (Mikolov et al., 2017; Grave et al., 2018), that deduplicates documents and identifies their language. We augment this pipeline with a filtering step to select documents that are close to high quality corpora like Wikipedia.",
