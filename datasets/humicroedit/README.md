### Dataset Summary

This is the task dataset for SemEval-2020 Task 7: Assessing Humor in Edited News Headlines.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[Task Description Page](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20970)

- Regression Task: In this task, given the original and the edited headline, the participant is required to predict the mean funniness of the edited headline. Success on this task is typically measured by achieving a *low* Mean Square Error.
- Predict the funnier of the two edited headlines: Given the original headline and two edited versions, the participant has to predict which edited version is the funnier of the two. Success on this task is typically measured by achieving a *high* accuracy.

### Languages

English

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances
For subtask-1, i.e Given the original and the edited headline, predict the mean funniness of the edited headline. 
```
{
  'id': 1183,
  'original': 'Kushner to visit <Mexico/> following latest trump tirades.',
  'edit': 'therapist',
  'grades': '33332',
  'meanGrade': 2.8
}
```
For subtask-2, i.e Given the original headline and two edited versions, predict which edited version is the funnier of the two.
```
{
  'id': 1183,
  'original1': 'Gene Cernan , Last <Astronaut/> on the Moon , Dies at 82',
  'edit1': 'Dancer',
  'grades1': '1113',
  'meanGrade1': 1.2, 
  'original2': 'Gene Cernan , Last Astronaut on the Moon , <Dies/> at 82',
  'edit2': 'impregnated',
  'grades2': '30001',
  'meanGrade2': 0.8, 
  'label': 1 
}
```

### Data Fields
For subtask-1
- `id`: Unique identifier of an edited headline.
- `original`: The headline with replaced word(s) identified with the </> tag.
- `edit`: The new word which replaces the word marked in </> tag in the original field.
- `grades`: 'grades' are the concatenation of all the grades by different annotators. 
- `mean` is the mean of all the judges scores.


For subtask-2
- `id`: Unique identifier of an edited headline.
- `original1`: The original headline with replaced word(s) identified with </> tag.
- `edit1`: The new word which replaces the word marked in </> tag in the `original1` field.
- `grades1`: The concatenation of all the grades annotated by different annotators for sentence1. 
- `meanGrade1` is the mean of all the judges scores for sentence1.
- `original2`: The original headline with replaced word(s) identified with </> tag.
- `edit2`: The new word which replaces the word marked in </> tag in the `original1` field.
- `grades2`: The concatenation of all the grades annotated by different annotators for the sentence2. 
- `meanGrade2` is the mean of all the judges scores for sentence2.
- `label` is 1 if sentence1 is more humourous than sentence2,
           2 if sentence 2 is more humorous than sentence1,
           0 if both the sentences are equally humorous

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Crowd-sourced the data by gamifying it as on the website funlines.co. Players rate the headlines on a scale of 0-4. 
Players are scored based on their editing and rating, and they
are ranked on the gameâ€™s leaderboard page.
