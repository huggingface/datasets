What about dancing in a rainy field with one hundred and fifty thousand other people while a famous rock band plays on a stage so far away that the performers look like ants?\nIt may sound strange but that is what many hundreds of thousands of young people in the UK do every summer.Why? Because summer is the time for outdoor music festivals.\nHeld on a farm, the Glastonbury Festival is the most well-known and popular festival in the UK.It began in 1970 and the first festival was attended by one thousand five hundred people each paying an admission price of PS1 -- the ticket included free milk from the farm.\nSince then the Glastonbury Festival has gone from strength to strength -- in 2004 one hundred and fifty thousand fans attended, paying PS112 each for a ticket to the three-day event.Tickets for the event sold out within three hours.Performers included superstars, such as Paul McCartney and James Brown, as well as new talent, like Franz Ferdinand and Joss Stone.\nAlthough many summer festivals are run on a profit-making basis, Glastonbury is a charity event, donating millions of pounds to local and international charities.\nGlastonbury is not unique  in using live music to raise money to fight global poverty.In July of this year, the Live 8 concerts were held simultaneously   in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin.Superstars such as Madonna, Sir Elton John and Stevie Wonder performed in order to highlight international poverty and debt.", "id": "high122.txt"}
