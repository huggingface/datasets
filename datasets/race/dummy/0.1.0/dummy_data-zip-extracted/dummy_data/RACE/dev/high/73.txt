But after a little practice he found that he was becoming very skilled and soon he was making some of the finest tacks.\nOld Mr. Smith died and the son because of the war lost all his goods. He had to leave home and settled down in another country.

He told them that he would make the tacks if they would help to get him settled in his workshop. The shoemakers were only too glad of the offer. And after a while, Mr. Smith found that he was soon making the finest tacks in the village.\n\"How funny it seems,\" he used to say, \"even making tacks can bring a fortune .\"", "id": "high73.txt"}
