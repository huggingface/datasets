{"blog_authorship_corpus": {"description": "The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of the collected posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person.\n\nEach blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the blogger\u2019s self-provided gender, age, industry and astrological sign. (All are labeled for gender and age but for many, industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.)\n\nAll bloggers included in the corpus fall into one of three age groups:\n- 8240 \"10s\" blogs (ages 13-17),\n- 8086 \"20s\" blogs (ages 23-27)\n- 2994 \"30s\" blogs (ages 33-47).\n\nFor each age group there are an equal number of male and female bloggers.\n\nEach blog in the corpus includes at least 200 occurrences of common English words. All formatting has been stripped with two exceptions. Individual posts within a single blogger are separated by the date of the following post and links within a post are denoted by the label urllink.\n\nThe corpus may be freely used for non-commercial research purposes.\n", "citation": "@inproceedings{schler2006effects,\n    title={Effects of age and gender on blogging.},\n    author={Schler, Jonathan and Koppel, Moshe and Argamon, Shlomo and Pennebaker, James W},\n    booktitle={AAAI spring symposium: Computational approaches to analyzing weblogs},\n    volume={6},\n    pages={199--205},\n    year={2006}\n}\n", "homepage": "https://lingcog.blogspot.com/p/datasets.html", "license": "", "features": {"text": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "date": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "gender": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "age": {"dtype": "int32", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "horoscope": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "job": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "task_templates": null, "builder_name": "blog_authorship_corpus", "config_name": "blog_authorship_corpus", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": null, "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 753833081, "num_examples": 689793, "dataset_name": "blog_authorship_corpus"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 41236028, "num_examples": 37919, "dataset_name": "blog_authorship_corpus"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1cGy4RNDV87ZHEXbiozABr9gsSrZpPaPz&export=download": {"num_bytes": 632898892, "checksum": "e89941d841b1652f4405583cfc98c86767bf739cc8876c96037f2a177aef8ebe"}}, "download_size": 632898892, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 795069109, "size_in_bytes": 1427968001}}
