### Dataset Summary

We present RO-STS - the Semantic Textual Similarity dataset for the Romanian language. It is a high-quality translation of the [STS English dataset](https://ixa2.si.ehu.eus/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark). RO-STS contains 8,628 sentence pairs with their similarity scores. The original English sentences were collected from news headlines, captions of images and user forums, and are categorized accordingly. The Romanian release follows this categorization and provides the same train/validation/test split with 5,749/1,500/1,379 sentence pairs in each subset.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[Needs More Information]

### Languages

The text dataset is in Romanian (`ro`)

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

An example looks like this:

```
{'score': 1.5,
 'sentence1': 'Un bărbat cântă la harpă.',
 'sentence2': 'Un bărbat cântă la claviatură.',
}
```

### Data Fields

- `score`: a float representing the semantic similarity score where 0.0 is the lowest score and 5.0 is the highest
- `sentence1`: a string representing a text
- `sentence2`: another string to compare the previous text with

### Data Splits

The train/validation/test split contain 5,749/1,500/1,379 sentence pairs.
