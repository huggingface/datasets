Felony offenses that involve explosives qualify as “violent crimes” for purposes of enhancing the sentences of career offenders. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (defining a “violent felony” as: “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... involves use of explosives”). Courts have found possession of a'bomb to be a crime of violence based on the lack of a nonviolent purpose for a bomb and the fact that, by its very nature, there is a substantial risk that the bomb would be used against the person or property of another. See United States v. Newman, 125 F.3d 863 (10th Cir.1997) (unpublished) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Dodge, 846 F.Supp. 181,",holding that possession of a pipe bomb is a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc  3142f1,holding that bank robbery by force and violence or intimidation under 18 usc  2113a is a crime of violence,holding that sexual assault of a child qualified as crime of violence under 18 usc  16,holding for the purposes of 18 usc  924e that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a violent felony as defined in 18 usc  924e2b,holding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc  16,0,0.652,0.647,0.67,0.639,0

This type of information may constitute trade secrets. See G.L.c. 266, §30 (defining “trade secret” as used in G.L.c. 93, §42, as including “anything tangible or intangible or electronically kept or stored, which constitutes, represents, evidences or records a secret scientific, technical, merchandising, production or management information, design, process, procedure, formula, invention or improvement”); Warner-Lambert Co., 427 Mass. at 49 (“ [Confidential and proprietary business information may be entitled to protection, even if such information cannot claim trade secret protection”); see, e.g., Augat, Inc., 409 Mass. at 173 (<HOLDING>). “Matters of public knowledge or of general",recognizing that even if a plaintiff claims certain information constitutes trade secrets its claim may not depend on that determination,holding that included among trade secrets employee may not appropriate from employer is certain information such as lists of customers,holding that supplier lists can be trade secrets under indianas uniform trade secrets act which uses the same definition of a trade secret as montana,recognizing that customer lists may be protectable trade secrets,recognizing a legitimate need to protect an employee from disclosing an employers trade secrets or other confidential information to a competitor,0.594,0,0.552,0.511,0.676,1

Or, if the estate has additional assets and the JT & T parties have a small, secured claim that is superior to all other claims, then they will likely recover on their claim regardless of whether the adversary action brought by Hyundai is successful. In either of these scenarios, permitting Hyundai to pursue the avoidance and recovery action could hardly be said to have a negative impact on the JT & T parties’ interests as creditors. See In re The Watch Ltd., 257 Fed.Appx. at 750 (stating, in dictum, that the creditor’s injury was too speculative where he could not show a likelihood of recovering on his unsecured claim); In re Richardson Indus.

We need go no further. IV. Criminal Possession of a Weapon Is a Violent Felony Lynch also argues that his 1989 conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree is not a violent felony under the ACCA. Lynch asserts that since he never admitted to having “intent to use the weapon unlawfully against another,” his conviction was based on “mere possession” and cannot constitute a violent felony. Lynch, however, pled guilty to the charge at issue in state court. Under New York law, “[a] person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the se Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

53132,"records destroyed 2-17-05.” Mr. Alexce offered nothing to suggest that any materials he submitted that were not duplicative were missing from the file, much less suggesting what those materials might have said that could be helpful to his claim. There is no force to the argument that the destruction of duplicative materials constitutes spoliation of evidence or that there is anything improper in the DVA’s practice of retaining only a single copy of particular medical records in veterans’ claim files in an effort to maintain orderly records. The routine destruction of duplicative documents does not present the risk of denying an adversary access to relevant information, which is what the doctrine of spoliation is directed to.

Dep’t of the Army, 573",holding no intentional spoliation occurred where defendant was not on notice that evidence was relevant to claim,holding that to consider whether to apply a spoliation sanction the evidence must be relevant to an issue in the case and the party who destroyed the evidence must be under a duty to preserve the evidence,holding that an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence requires proof that evidence was destroyed with a culpable state of mind and that it was relevant to the partys claim or defense,recognizing a tort for the intentional spoliation of evidence,holding that spoliation may be a basis for a cause of action where a third party has negligently destroyed material evidence but stating that jury charges that presume missing evidence weighs against the spoliator and discovery sanctions  are available when spoliation is charged against an opposing party,0.608,0.602,0,0.671,0.693,2

Her performance was thus an insubstantial part of the agreement, and therefore was insufficient to make the statute of frauds inapplicable. Because the alleged contract was not in wilting as required by the statute of frauds, and because no exception to the statute of frauds is applicable, we hold that the contract is unenforceable and Dr. Johnson therefore cannot sue for its breach. C. As an alternative to the breach of contract claim, Dr. Johnson argues that UHS should be prevented from refusing to provide her with t 90, 322 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1984) (same), with Augusta Surgical Ctr., Inc. v.
