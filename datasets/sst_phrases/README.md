### Dataset Summary

The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is the first corpus with fully labeled parse trees that allows for a
complete analysis of the compositional effects of
sentiment in language. 
This version includes only the phrases forming each sentence along with their sentiment score (0-10). It doesn't include the syntax trees or the labels for each complete sentence, similar to the SST-2 dataset found in GLUE.
