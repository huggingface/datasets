### Dataset Summary

The SciQ dataset contains 13,679 crowdsourced science exam questions about Physics, Chemistry and Biology, among others. The questions are in multiple-choice format with 4 answer options each. For the majority of the questions, an additional paragraph with supporting evidence for the correct answer is provided.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 2.69 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 7.32 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 10.01 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "correct_answer": "coriolis effect",
    "distractor1": "muon effect",
    "distractor2": "centrifugal effect",
    "distractor3": "tropical effect",
    "question": "What phenomenon makes global winds blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the northern hemisphere and northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere?",
    "support": "\"Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to..."
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `distractor3`: a `string` feature.
- `distractor1`: a `string` feature.
- `distractor2`: a `string` feature.
- `correct_answer`: a `string` feature.
- `support`: a `string` feature.
