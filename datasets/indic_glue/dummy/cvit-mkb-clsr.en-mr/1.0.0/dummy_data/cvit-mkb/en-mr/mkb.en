I salute the divine flame respectfully.
To make this Diwali memorable, what could be a better way than an attempt to let light spread its radiance, encouraging positivity, with a prayer to quell the feeling of animosity
These days Diwali is celebrated across many countries.
And notably, it is not limited to Indian communities even governments, citizens and social organisations wholeheartedly celebrate Diwali with gaiety and fervour.
In a way, they nurture a microcosm of India at their respective places.
