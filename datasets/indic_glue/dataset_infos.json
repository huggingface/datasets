COPA consists of 1000 questions, split equally\ninto development and test sets of 500 questions each. Each question is composed of a premise and two\nalternatives, where the task is to select the alternative that more plausibly has a causal relation\nwith the premise. The correct alternative is randomized so that the expected performance of randomly\nguessing is 50%. This dataset is translated and publicly released for 3 languages by AI4Bharat.\n", "citation": "    @inproceedings{kakwani2020indicnlpsuite,\n    title={{IndicNLPSuite: Monolingual Corpora, Evaluation Benchmarks and Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Indian Languages}},\n    author={Divyanshu Kakwani and Anoop Kunchukuttan and Satish Golla and Gokul N.C. and Avik Bhattacharyya and Mitesh M.

Given a document in any of these languages, our framework is able to identify name mentions, assign a coarse-grained or fine-grained type to each mention, and link it to an English Knowledge Base (KB) if it is linkable. We achieve this goal by performing a series of new KB mining methods: generating {``}silver-standard{''} annotations by transferring annotations from English to other languages through cross-lingual links and KB properties, refining annotations through self-training and topic selection, deriving language-specific morphology features from anchor links, and mining word translation pairs from cross-lingual links. Both name tagging and linking results for 282 languages are promising on Wikipedia data and on-Wikipedia data.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/indic-glue/#named-entity-recognition", "license": "", "features": {"tokens": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "ner_tags": {"feature": {"num_classes": 7, "names": ["B-LOC", "B-ORG", "B-PER", "I-LOC", "I-ORG", "I-PER", "O"], "names_file": null, "id": null, "_type": "ClassLabel"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "additional_info": {"feature": {"feature": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}, "length": -1, "id": null, "_type": "Sequence"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "builder_name": "indic_glue", "config_name": "wiki-ner.te", "version": {"version_str": "1.0.0", "description": "", "major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 96016, "num_examples": 7978, "dataset_name": "indic_glue"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 10372, "num_examples": 841, "dataset_name": "indic_glue"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 13600, "num_examples": 1110, "dataset_name": "indic_glue"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://storage.googleapis.com/ai4bharat-public-indic-nlp-corpora/evaluations/wikiann-ner.tar.gz": {"num_bytes": 5980272, "checksum": "2bb060394a6816c9a4f3c31976d9819174067cc75b976bc4b00e5c624cd2751d"}}, "download_size": 5980272, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 119988, "size_in_bytes": 6100260}}
