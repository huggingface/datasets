### Dataset Summary

A large medical text dataset (14Go) curated to 4Go for abbreviation disambiguation, designed for natural language understanding pre-training in the medical domain. For example, DHF can be disambiguated to dihydrofolate, diastolic heart failure, dengue hemorragic fever or dihydroxyfumarate

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Medical abbreviation disambiguation

### Languages

English (en)

## Dataset Structure

Each file is a table consisting of three columns:
* text: The normalized content of an abstract
* location: The location (index) of each abbreviation that was substituted
* label: The word at that was substituted at the given location


### Data Instances

An example from the train split is:

```
{'abstract_id': 14145090,
 'text': 'velvet antlers vas are commonly used in traditional chinese medicine and invigorant and contain many PET components for health promotion the velvet antler peptide svap is one of active components in vas based on structural study the svap interacts with tgfÎ² receptors and disrupts the tgfÎ² pathway we hypothesized that svap prevents cardiac fibrosis from pressure overload by blocking tgfÎ² signaling SDRs underwent TAC tac or a sham operation T3 one month rats received either svap mgkgday or vehicle for an additional one month tac surgery induced significant cardiac dysfunction FB activation and fibrosis these effects were improved by treatment with svap in the heart tissue tac remarkably increased the expression of tgfÎ² and connective tissue growth factor ctgf ROS species C2 and the phosphorylation C2 of smad and ERK kinases erk svap inhibited the increases in reactive oxygen species C2 ctgf expression and the phosphorylation of smad and erk but not tgfÎ² expression in cultured cardiac fibroblasts angiotensin ii ang ii had similar effects compared to tac surgery such as increases in Î±smapositive CFs and collagen synthesis svap eliminated these effects by disrupting tgfÎ² IB to its receptors and blocking ang iitgfÎ² downstream signaling these results demonstrated that svap has antifibrotic effects by blocking the tgfÎ² pathway in CFs',
 'location': [63],
 'label': ['transverse aortic constriction']}
 ```

### Data Fields

The column types are:
* text: content of the abstract as a string
* location: index of the substitution as an integer
* label: substitued word as a string

### Data Splits

The following files are present:

* `full_data.csv`: The full dataset with all 14M abstracts.
* `train.csv`: The subset used to train the baseline and proposed models.
* `valid.csv`: The subset used to validate the model during training for hyperparameter selection.
* `test.csv`: The subset used to evaluate the model and report the results in the tables.

## Dataset Creation


### Curation Rationale

[More Information Needed]

### Source Data

The original dataset was retrieved and modified from the [NLM website](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html).

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

[More Information Needed]

### Annotations

Details on how the abbreviations were created can be found in section 2.2 (Dataset Creation) of the [ACL ClinicalNLP paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.clinicalnlp-1.15.pdf).

#### Annotation process

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the annotators?

### Personal and Sensitive Information

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

[More Information Needed]

### Discussion of Biases

Since the abstracts are written in English, the data is biased towards anglo-centric medical research. If you plan to use a model pre-trained on this dataset for a predominantly non-English community, it is important to verify whether there are negative biases present in your model, and ensure that they are correctly mitigated. For instance, you could fine-tune your dataset on a multilingual medical disambiguation dataset, or collect a dataset specific to your use case.

In this work, we present MeDAL, a large medical text dataset curated for abbreviation disambiguation, designed for natural language understanding pre-training in the medical domain. We pre-trained several models of common architectures on this dataset and empirically showed that such pre-training leads to improved performance and convergence speed when fine-tuning on downstream medical tasks.",
