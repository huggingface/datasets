## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:**  https://adversarialglue.github.io/
- **Repository:**
- **Paper:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02840.pdf)
- **Leaderboard:**
- **Point of Contact:**
Adversarial GLUE Benchmark (AdvGLUE) is a comprehensive robustness evaluation benchmark that focuses on the adversarial robustness evaluation of language models. It covers five natural language understanding tasks from the famous GLUE tasks and is an adversarial version of GLUE benchmark.

AdvGLUE considers textual adversarial attacks from different perspectives and hierarchies, including word-level transformations, sentence-level manipulations, and human-written adversarial examples, which provide comprehensive coverage of various adversarial linguistic phenomena.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

Leaderboard available on the homepage: [https://adversarialglue.github.io/](https://adversarialglue.github.io/).

### Languages

AdvGLUE deviates from the GLUE dataset, which has a base language of English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 198 KB
- **Example**:
```python
>>> datasets.load_dataset('adv_glue', 'adv_sst2')['validation'][0]
{'sentence': "it 's an uneven treat that bores fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .", 'label': 1, 'idx': 0}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same as in the GLUE dataset, which differ by task.


The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### adv_mnli
- `premise`: a `string` feature.
- `hypothesis`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `entailment` (0), `neutral` (1), `contradiction` (2).
- `idx`: a `int32` feature.

#### adv_mnli_matched
- `premise`: a `string` feature.
- `hypothesis`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `entailment` (0), `neutral` (1), `contradiction` (2).
- `idx`: a `int32` feature.

#### adv_mnli_mismatched
- `premise`: a `string` feature.
- `hypothesis`: a `string` feature.
- `label`: a classification label, with possible values including `entailment` (0), `neutral` (1), `contradiction` (2).
- `idx`: a `int32` feature.
