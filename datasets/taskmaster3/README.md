### Dataset Summary

Taskmaster is dataset for goal oriented conversations. The Taskmaster-3 dataset consists of 23,757 movie ticketing dialogs.
By "movie ticketing" we mean conversations where the customer's goal is to purchase tickets after deciding
on theater, time, movie name, number of tickets, and date, or opt out of the transaction. This collection
was created using the "self-dialog" method. This means a single, crowd-sourced worker is
paid to create a conversation writing turns for both speakers, i.e. the customer and the ticketing agent.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

### Data Fields

Each conversation in the data file has the following structure:

- `conversation_id`: A universally unique identifier with the prefix 'dlg-'. The ID has no meaning.
- `utterances`: A list of utterances that make up the conversation.
- `instructions`: Instructions for the crowdsourced worker used in creating the conversation.
- `vertical`: In this dataset the vertical for all dialogs is "Movie Tickets".
- `scenario`: This is the title of the instructions for each dialog.

Each utterance has the following fields:

- `index`: A 0-based index indicating the order of the utterances in the conversation.
- `speaker`: Either USER or ASSISTANT, indicating which role generated this utterance.
- `text`: The raw text of the utterance. In case of self dialogs (one_person_dialogs), this is written by the crowdsourced worker. In case of the WOz dialogs, 'ASSISTANT' turns are written and 'USER' turns are transcribed from the spoken recordings of crowdsourced workers.
- `segments`: A list of various text spans with semantic annotations.
- `apis`: An array of API invocations made during the utterance.

Each API has the following structure:

- `name`: The name of the API invoked (e.g. find_movies).
- `index`: The index of the parent utterance.
- `args`: A `list` of `dict` with keys `arg_name` and `arg_value` which represent the name of the argument and the value for the argument respectively. 
- `response`: A `list` of `dict`s with keys `response_name` and `response_value` which represent the name of the response and the value for the response respectively. 

Each segment has the following fields:

- `start_index`: The position of the start of the annotation in the utterance text.
- `end_index`: The position of the end of the annotation in the utterance text.
- `text`: The raw text that has been annotated.
- `annotations`: A list of annotation details for this segment.

Each annotation has a single field:

- `name`: The annotation name.
