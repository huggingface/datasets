        "nbestanswers": [
            "A small group of politicians believed strongly that the fact that Saddam Hussien remained in power after the first Gulf War was a signal of weakness to the rest of the world, one that invited attacks and terrorism. Shortly after taking power with George Bush in 2000 and after the attack on 9/11, they were able to use the terrorist attacks to justify war with Iraq on this basis and exaggerated threats of the development of weapons of mass destruction. The military strength of the U.S. and the brutality of Saddam's regime led them to imagine that the military and political victory would be relatively easy.", 
            "Because there is a lot of oil in Iraq.", 
            "It is tempting to say that the US invaded Iraq because it has lots of oil, but the US is not a country in a deep economic problem that capturing other country\u2019s oil is an actual need for survival. It is more likely that the Iraq invading Kuwait scenario would fall under that assumption.. I think that the US government has come to a conclusion that we are on the verge of a war of religions, or more likely ideologies. It would be presumptuous to try and determent a one cause to the coming war. . I think that the world wide spread of the media with its many forms (Cable, Satellite, Internet, etc.)  have pushed the Moslem regimes to the extreme, fearing that secularity and democratic influence is penetrating their country and will result in an up raising against them. One of the best way to maintain the power that you have and even gain more of it, is by hatred. When the common man is occupied hating an outside enemy, its hatred is kept out side the county and would not be directed towards the regime. . So- I believe that the US understands that the fanatic Moslem regimes have already started a war on the democratic world and now is the time to try a fight it.. . So why invade Iraq? Because it is a huge, week Moslem country that thought to be easy to defeat. . This is exactly the same reason why Afghanistan was first and Syria is next in line.", 
            "I think Yuval is pretty spot on. It's a proving ground and a focal point for terror activity that's not on American soil. And, because no one liked Saddam Hussein, no other countries (even in the Middle East) were about to rise up and join his side.. . Rabid speculation: now the Pentagon has a model that says it takes ~5 years, ~$200B and ~2,000 casualties to \"rebuild\" a dictatorship into a democracy. Who's next on the list?"

            "Don't try this yourself but this is what the old fashioned way is - done in some villages in other parts of the world.. . The guy who dismantles, wears a mask with holes at the eyes so he can see, carries a big sack with burning coals in it.  He also wraps his hands with thick cloths, carries an empty bag to collect the honey in it.. He then collects the honey in the empty bag, pulls the hive into the bag of coals.. . If he just wants to collect the honey, he would leave after collecting the honey - but the bag of coals is used to choke & burn the bees if he wanted to get rid of the hive.. . That's a bit like coding in COBOL & assembly :)"

        "question": "Why don't European restaurants serve water?", 
        "nbestanswers": [
            "There's a general belief in Europe (and in fact elsewhere in the world, such as China) that it's unhealthy to drink water with a meal because it dilutes the digestive juices. Wine is OK because it stimulates digestion, and mineral waters are also considered digestives.. . In general, Europeans are much more concerned with the digestive process than Americans.", 
            "I'd like to take a different approach in answering this. I think geographical location and higher availability of other drinks probably is a bigger reason that water is not consumed as much by people in certain regions, including Europe. I believe and many visitors have commented that children drink less water and more soda in USA.  This is primarily due to the fact that soda companies advertise a lot, making it more attractive. Secondly, SODA IS ATTRACTIVE, and according to a few medical experts it's even addictive (yes, caffeine is addictive to some extent).  . . Secondly the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drinks.  For example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place, you would probably & naturally  be drinking more water rather than if you are from   a country like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland.. . Another reason is that people being less immune to impure water (like tap water) and being more dependent on bottled water makes the water less affordable and less available.  If you need to pay  extra or need to work harder to get the commodity, you may resort to cheaper commodity or a near by commodity.. . Another reason I also feel is the commute using Cars rather than walking or cycling.  If you walk more to commute (like walk to train stations, walk a few blocks to get groceries, etc.) then you are more likely to drink water when compared to driving to every place you go and exert yourself much less.  In many other countries people walk, walk and walk for several small things.. . Lack of education and awareness is also a reason for not consuming enough water. Not many people (except for few educated ones)know that 80% of our body is water.  Even if they knew, ppl forget that fact easily and resort to \"other drinks\".. . There are simply several reasons or combination of reasons for not consuming enough water by the people in general.. . Finally, after having said all this,. Beer Happens!"

        "question": "Why hybrid cars gas mileage is better in city ?", 
        "nbestanswers": [
            "hybrid cars save energy in two ways: 1.by storing energy from the breaks2.by engaging the gas motor only in it's most effective work RPM meaning that the system will engage the gas motor mostly at coursing speed (close to the most efficient motor RPM)Having said the above, driving in the city almost never gets you to the efficient RPM.Also- it is true that the same energy that is being stored in the cars' battery needed to be generated by chemic energy. The cool thing about it is that the pollution can be outside of the city and not in the city. (Like in San Francisco, the electric buses generate the same pollution as a gas buses it is just not in the city.You can also add that electric engines are much quieter then gas engines.So- all in all- I the hybrid benefits are more visible in city driving", 
            "The gas mileage for some hybrids is better in the city because they spend more time using their electric motor instead of their gas engine.  Most hybrids have battery packs which are charged by what is called \"generative breaking\".  Instead of slowing down with traditional braking, these cars store some of the energy from braking into a battery pack.  Then when the light changes and the car moves again, the energy stored in the battery can be used to move the car, or assist the engine in moving the car.. . In the city this effect can be more pronounced because of more frequent stopping and starting.", 
            "There are the two reasons mentioned already - using the energy from the breaks and using the gas engine only when it can work efficiently.. . One more thing to note is that for several cars, the hybrid model of a car has a smaller gas engine than the regular models (e.g. for Honda Civic the gas engine for the hybrid model is 1.3L, which is not available in the regular models). So even without the other things, this engine will get better gas mileage than the larger engines."
