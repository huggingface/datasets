### Dataset Summary

FQuAD: French Question Answering Dataset
We introduce FQuAD, a native French Question Answering Dataset.

FQuAD contains 25,000+ question and answer pairs.
Finetuning CamemBERT on FQuAD yields a F1 score of 88% and an exact match of 77.9%.
Developped to provide a SQuAD equivalent in the French language. Questions are original and based on high quality Wikipedia articles.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

- `closed-domain-qa`, `text-retrieval`: This dataset is intended to be used for `closed-domain-qa`, but can also be used for information retrieval tasks.

### Languages

This dataset is exclusively in French, with context data from Wikipedia and questions from French university students (`fr`).

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### default

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 3.14 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 6.62 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 9.76 MB

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "answers": {
        "answers_starts": [161, 46, 204],
        "texts": ["La Vierge aux rochers", "documents contemporains", "objets de spéculations"]
    },
    "context": "\"Les deux tableaux sont certes décrits par des documents contemporains à leur création mais ceux-ci ne le font qu'indirectement ...",
    "questions": ["Que concerne principalement les documents ?", "Par quoi sont décrit les deux tableaux ?", "Quels types d'objets sont les deux tableaux aux yeux des chercheurs ?"]
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `context`: a `string` feature.
- `questions`: a `list` of `string` features.
- `answers`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `texts`: a `string` feature.
  - `answers_starts`: a `int32` feature.

### Data Splits

The FQuAD dataset has 3 splits: _train_, _validation_, and _test_. The _test_ split is however not released publicly at the moment. The splits contain disjoint sets of articles. The following table contains stats about each split.

Dataset Split | Number of Articles in Split | Number of paragraphs in split | Number of questions in split
--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------
Train | 117 | 4921 | 20731
Validation | 768 | 51.0% | 3188
Test | 10 | 532 | 2189

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale
  The FQuAD dataset was created by Illuin technology. It was developped to provide a SQuAD equivalent in the French language. Questions are original and based on high quality Wikipedia articles.

### Source Data

The text used for the contexts are from the curated list of French High-Quality Wikipedia [articles](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%C3%A9gorie:Article_de_qualit%C3%A9).
### Annotations

Annotations (spans and questions) are written by students of the CentraleSupélec school of engineering.
Wikipedia articles were scraped and Illuin used an internally-developped tool to help annotators ask questions and indicate the answer spans.
Annotators were given paragraph sized contexts and asked to generate 4/5 non-trivial questions about information in the context.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

No personal or sensitive information is included in this dataset. This has been manually verified by the dataset curators.

## Considerations for Using the Data

Users should consider this dataset is sampled from Wikipedia data which might not be representative of all QA use cases.

### Social Impact of Dataset

The social biases of this dataset have not yet been investigated.

### Discussion of Biases

The social biases of this dataset have not yet been investigated, though articles have been selected by their quality and objectivity.

### Other Known Limitations

The limitations of the FQuAD dataset have not yet been investigated.
