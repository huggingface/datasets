### Dataset Summary

A new dataset of 7,787 genuine grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions, assembled to encourage research in
 advanced question-answering. The dataset is partitioned into a Challenge Set and an Easy Set, where the former contains
 only questions answered incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurrence algorithm. We are also
 including a corpus of over 14 million science sentences relevant to the task, and an implementation of three neural baseline models for this dataset. We pose ARC as a challenge to the community.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### ARC-Challenge

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 649.30 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 0.79 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 650.09 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "answerKey": "B",
    "choices": {
        "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        "text": ["Shady areas increased.", "Food sources increased.", "Oxygen levels increased.", "Available water increased."]
    },
    "id": "Mercury_SC_405487",
    "question": "One year, the oak trees in a park began producing more acorns than usual. The next year, the population of chipmunks in the park also increased. Which best explains why there were more chipmunks the next year?"
}
```

#### ARC-Easy

- **Size of downloaded dataset files:** 649.30 MB
- **Size of the generated dataset:** 1.38 MB
- **Total amount of disk used:** 650.68 MB

An example of 'train' looks as follows.
```
{
    "answerKey": "B",
    "choices": {
        "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        "text": ["Shady areas increased.", "Food sources increased.", "Oxygen levels increased.", "Available water increased."]
    },
    "id": "Mercury_SC_405487",
    "question": "One year, the oak trees in a park began producing more acorns than usual. The next year, the population of chipmunks in the park also increased. Which best explains why there were more chipmunks the next year?"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### ARC-Challenge
- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `choices`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `text`: a `string` feature.
  - `label`: a `string` feature.
- `answerKey`: a `string` feature.

#### ARC-Easy
- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `choices`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `text`: a `string` feature.
  - `label`: a `string` feature.
- `answerKey`: a `string` feature.
