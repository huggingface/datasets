### Dataset Summary

Quoref is a QA dataset which tests the coreferential reasoning capability of reading comprehension systems. In this
span-selection benchmark containing 24K questions over 4.7K paragraphs from Wikipedia, a system must resolve hard
coreferences before selecting the appropriate span(s) in the paragraphs for answering questions.

An example of 'validation' looks as follows.
```
This example was too long and was cropped:

{
    "answers": {
        "answer_start": [1633],
        "text": ["Frankie"]
    },
    "context": "\"Frankie Bono, a mentally disturbed hitman from Cleveland, comes back to his hometown in New York City during Christmas week to ...",
    "id": "bfc3b34d6b7e73c0bd82a009db12e9ce196b53e6",
    "question": "What is the first name of the person who has until New Year's Eve to perform a hit?",
    "title": "Blast of Silence",
    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_of_Silence"
}
```

### Data Fields

The data fields are the same among all splits.

#### default
- `id`: a `string` feature.
- `question`: a `string` feature.
- `context`: a `string` feature.
- `title`: a `string` feature.
- `url`: a `string` feature.
- `answers`: a dictionary feature containing:
  - `answer_start`: a `int32` feature.
  - `text`: a `string` feature.
