What is cryo-EM? A structural biology method
What is air-water interface? The air-water interface (AWI) is the boundary where sample solution contacts the air.
What are the steps in cryo-EM workflow? Sample preparation, grid preparation, data collection, data processing and modeling.
What is radiation damage? Deposition of kinetic energy onto the sample due to inelastic scattering between electrons and the frozen specimen.
What software package could be used for processing cryo-EM data? RELION, cryoSPARC, EMAN2, BSoft and many more
How to get thinner ice on cryo-EM grids? Optimize grid making procedure, starting with longer blotting time.
How does cryo-EM work? Cryo-EM works by freezing samples in vitreous ice, imaging them with an electron microscope, and reconstructing the structures from the collected images.
Are there any limitations or drawbacks of cryo-EM? Limitations of cryo-EM include the need for high-quality samples, potential radiation damage, and challenges in resolving flexible or dynamic regions.
How is the resolution of a cryo-EM structure determined? In cryo-EM, the resolution of the map is estimated by the correlation of two independently calculated structures in various resolution shells in Fourier space, termed the Fourier shell correlation (FSC).
What are the requirements for sample preparation in cryo-EM? Sample preparation for cryo-EM requires isolating the macromolecule of interest, applying it to a grid, and vitrifying it by rapid freezing.
What are the advantages of cryo-EM compared to other structural biology techniques? Cryo-EM offers advantages such as the ability to study large complexes, flexibility in sample preparation, and the potential to reach near-atomic resolution.
How can I increase the number of particles in the holes of a cryo-EM grid? Concentrate your sample: Increase the concentration of your macromolecule of interest during sample preparation to enhance the number of particles loaded onto the grid.
How can I reduce a beam-shift during data collection in cryo-electron microscopy? Utilize real-time beam-shift correction methods if available in your cryo-EM instrument.
