# Cache management

When you download a dataset from Hugging Face, the data are stored locally on your computer.
Files from Hugging Face are stored as usual in the `huggingface_hub` cache, which is at `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` by default.
See the [Hub cache documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache) for more details and how to change its location.

The Hub cache allows 🤗 Datasets to avoid re-downloading dataset files from Hugging Face every time you use them. 

🤗 Datasets also has its own cache to store datasets converted in Arrow format (the format used by [`Dataset`] objects).

This guide focuses on the 🤗 Datasets cache and will show you how to:

- Change the cache directory.
- Control how a dataset is loaded from the cache.
- Clean up cache files in the directory.
- Enable or disable caching.

## Cache directory

The default 🤗 Datasets cache directory is `~/.cache/huggingface/datasets`. Change the cache location by setting the shell environment variable, `HF_HOME` to another directory:

```
$ export HF_HOME="/path/to/another/directory/datasets"
```

Alternatively, you can set the `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` environment variable to control only the datasets-specific cache directory:

```
$ export HF_DATASETS_CACHE="/path/to/datasets_cache"
```

⚠️ This only applies to files written by the `datasets` library (e.g., Arrow files and indices).  
It does **not** affect files downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub (such as models, tokenizers, or raw dataset sources), which are located in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` by default and controlled separately via the `HF_HUB_CACHE` variable:

```
$ export HF_HUB_CACHE="/path/to/hub_cache"
```

💡 If you'd like to relocate all Hugging Face caches — including datasets and hub downloads — use the `HF_HOME` variable instead:

```
$ export HF_HOME="/path/to/cache_root"
```

This results in:
- datasets cache → `/path/to/cache_root/datasets`
- hub cache → `/path/to/cache_root/hub`

These distinctions are especially useful when working in shared environments or networked file systems (e.g., NFS).  
See [issue #7480](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/7480) for discussion on how users encountered unexpected cache locations when `HF_HUB_CACHE` was not set alongside `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`.

When you load a dataset, you also have the option to change where the data is cached. Change the `cache_dir` parameter to the path you want:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset('username/dataset', cache_dir="/path/to/another/directory/datasets")
```

## Download mode

After you download a dataset, control how it is loaded by [`load_dataset`] with the `download_mode` parameter. By default, 🤗 Datasets will reuse a dataset if it exists. But if you need the original dataset without any processing functions applied, re-download the files as shown below:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset('rajpurkar/squad', download_mode='force_redownload')
```

Refer to [`DownloadMode`] for a full list of download modes.

## Cache files

Clean up the Arrow cache files in the directory with [`Dataset.cleanup_cache_files`]:

```py
# Returns the number of removed cache files
>>> dataset.cleanup_cache_files()
2
```

## Enable or disable caching

If you're using a cached file locally, it will automatically reload the dataset with any previous transforms you applied to the dataset. Disable this behavior by setting the argument `load_from_cache_file=False` in [`Dataset.map`]:

```py
>>> updated_dataset = small_dataset.map(add_prefix, load_from_cache_file=False)
```

In the example above, 🤗 Datasets will execute the function `add_prefix` over the entire dataset again instead of loading the dataset from its previous state.

Disable caching on a global scale with [`disable_caching`]:

```py
>>> from datasets import disable_caching
>>> disable_caching()
```

When you disable caching, 🤗 Datasets will no longer reload cached files when applying transforms to datasets. Any transform you apply on your dataset will be need to be reapplied.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to reuse a dataset from scratch, try setting the `download_mode` parameter in [`load_dataset`] instead.

## Improve performance

Disabling the cache and copying the dataset in-memory will speed up dataset operations. There are two options for copying the dataset in-memory:

1. Set `datasets.config.IN_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE` to a nonzero value (in bytes) that fits in your RAM memory.

2. Set the environment variable `HF_DATASETS_IN_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE` to a nonzero value. Note that the first method takes higher precedence.

### Specific use cases

Below are some tips to optimize dataset usage for different constraints:

#### How to make datasets the fastest

- **Use in-memory datasets:** If your dataset fits in RAM, set `datasets.config.IN_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE` (or the environment variable `HF_DATASETS_IN_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE`) to allow holding the full dataset in memory. This avoids disk reads and is the fastest access method.
- **Disable caching when not needed:** If you repeatedly apply the same transforms, you can disable caching to save overhead, as shown above.
- **Use multiprocessing and batch operations:** Many dataset methods (like `map`) support `num_proc` for parallel processing and `batched=True` to process multiple rows at once, which can significantly speed up operations.
- **Work with Arrow/Parquet formats:** These formats are optimized for fast reads and are natively supported by 🤗 Datasets.

#### How to make datasets take the least RAM

- **Use IterableDataset:** For very large datasets, convert your dataset to an `IterableDataset` using `to_iterable_dataset()`. This processes data in a streaming fashion, minimizing memory usage.
- **Use streaming datasets:** When loading with `load_dataset`, pass `streaming=True` to avoid keeping the full dataset in memory.
- **Disable in-memory mode:** Ensure `datasets.config.IN_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE` is set to 0 (default), so datasets are read from disk rather than loaded fully in RAM.
- **Work with disk-backed formats:** Datasets in Arrow or Parquet format are designed for efficient disk access.

#### How to make datasets take the least hard drive memory

- **Clean up cache files:** Use `dataset.cleanup_cache_files()` to remove intermediate Arrow cache files that are no longer needed.
- **Use streaming mode:** Streaming mode avoids downloading the full dataset and stores only the currently accessed samples.
- **Remove unused columns:** Drop columns you don't need with `dataset.remove_columns([...])` to reduce the dataset size.
- **Choose efficient formats:** Parquet and Arrow are compact, but if you don't need local disk copies, rely on streaming and avoid using `load_from_disk`.
