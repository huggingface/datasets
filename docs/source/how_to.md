The how-to guides offer a more comprehensive overview of all the tools ðŸ¤— Datasets offers and how to use them. This will help you tackle some of the messier real-world datasets, where you may need to manipulate the dataset structure or content to get it ready for training.

The guides assume you are familiar and comfortable with the ðŸ¤— Datasets basics. We recommend newer users check out our [tutorials](tutorial) first.
