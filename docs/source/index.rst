Datasets is a library for easily accessing and sharing datasets, and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

Datasets provides the simplest and fastest way for users to download a dataset, and get it ready for training in a deep learning model. With built-in support for NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch and TensorFlow, Datasets ensures you can use it with a framework of your choice. We designed Datasets for speed and efficiency by using the Apache Arrow format, memory-mapping, multiprocessing, and smart caching. Datasets also supports sharing new datasets with the wider NLP community, making more resources available for training on different NLP tasks. There are currently over 900 datasets available, and in more than 100 languages.

Get started today and find your dataset on the `Datasets Hub <https://huggingface.co/datasets>`_, or take an in-depth look inside a dataset with the live `Datasets Viewer <https://huggingface.co/datasets/viewer/>`_.
