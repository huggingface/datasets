# Share a dataset to the Hub

The [Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) is home to an extensive collection of community-curated and popular research datasets. We encourage you to share your dataset to the Hub to help grow the ML community and accelerate progress for everyone. All contributions are welcome; adding a dataset is just a drag and drop away!

Start by [creating a Hugging Face Hub account](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one yet.

## Upload with the Hub UI

The Hub's web-based interface allows users without any developer experience to upload a dataset.

### Create a repository

A repository hosts all your dataset files, including the revision history, making storing more than one dataset version possible.

1. Click on your profile and select **New Dataset** to create a new dataset repository. 
2. Pick a name for your dataset, and choose whether it is a public or private dataset. A public dataset is visible to anyone, whereas a private dataset can only be viewed by you or members of your organization.

### Upload dataset

1. Once you've created a repository, navigate to the **Files and versions** tab to add a file. Select **Add file** to upload your dataset files. We currently support the following data formats: CSV, JSON, JSON lines, text, and Parquet. For this tutorial, you can use the following sample CSV files: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/stevhliu/demo/raw/main/train.csv" download>train.csv</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/stevhliu/demo/raw/main/test.csv" download>test.csv</a>.

</div>

2. Drag and drop your dataset files and add a brief descriptive commit message.

</div>

3. After uploading your dataset files, they are stored in your dataset repository.

### Create a Dataset card

Adding a Dataset card is super valuable for helping users find your dataset and understand how to use it responsibly.

1. Click on **Create Dataset Card** to create a Dataset card. This button creates a `README.md` file in your repository.

<div class="flex justify-center">
    <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/datasets/dataset_card.png"/>
</div>

2. Feel free to copy this Dataset card [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/main/templates/README.md) to help you fill out all the relevant fields. 

3. The Dataset card uses structured tags to help users discover your dataset on the Hub. Use the [Dataset Tagger](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/datasets-tagging) to help you generate the appropriate tags.

4. Copy the generated tags, paste them at the top of your Dataset card, and then commit your changes.

</div>

For a detailed example of what a good Dataset card should look like, take a look at the [CNN DailyMail Dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail).

### Load dataset

Once your dataset is stored on the Hub, anyone can load it with the [`load_dataset`] function:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> dataset = load_dataset("stevhliu/demo")
```

## Upload with Python

Users who prefer to upload a dataset programmatically can use the [huggingface_hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) library. This library allows users to interact with the Hub from Python. 

1. Begin by installing the library:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

2. To upload a dataset on the Hub in Python, you need to log in to your Hugging Face account:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

3. Use the [`push_to_hub()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict.push_to_hub) function to help you add, commit, and push a file to your repository:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> dataset = load_dataset("stevhliu/demo")
# dataset = dataset.map(...)  # do all your processing here
>>> dataset.push_to_hub("stevhliu/processed_demo")
```

To set your dataset as private, set the `private` parameter to `True`. This parameter will only work if you are creating a repository for the first time.

```py
>>> dataset.push_to_hub("stevhliu/private_processed_demo", private=True)
```

### Privacy

A private dataset is only accessible by you. Similarly, if you share a dataset within your organization, then members of the organization can also access the dataset.

Load a private dataset by providing your authentication token to the `use_auth_token` parameter:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a private individual dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset("stevhliu/demo", use_auth_token=True)

# Load a private organization dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset("organization/dataset_name", use_auth_token=True)
```
