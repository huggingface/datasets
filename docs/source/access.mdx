# The Dataset object

In the previous tutorial, you learned how to successfully load a dataset. This section will familiarize you with the [`Dataset`] object. You will learn about the metadata stored inside a Dataset object, and the basics of querying a Dataset object to return rows and columns.

A [`Dataset`] object is returned when you load an instance of a dataset. This object behaves like a normal Python container.

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset('glue', 'mrpc', split='train')
```

## Metadata

The [`Dataset`] object contains a lot of useful information about your dataset. For example, access [`DatasetInfo`] to return a short description of the dataset, the authors, and even the dataset size. This will give you a quick snapshot of the datasets most important attributes.

```py
>>> dataset.info
DatasetInfo(
    description='GLUE, the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(https://gluebenchmark.com/) is a collection of resources for training,\nevaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems.\n\n', 
    citation='@inproceedings{dolan2005automatically,\n  title={Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases},\n  author={Dolan, William B and Brockett, Chris},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing (IWP2005)},\n  year={2005}\n}\n@inproceedings{wang2019glue,\n  title={{GLUE}: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding},\n  author={Wang, Alex and Singh, Amanpreet and Michael, Julian and Hill, Felix and Levy, Omer and Bowman, Samuel R.},\n  note={In the Proceedings of ICLR.},\n  year={2019}\n}\n', homepage='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398',

)
```

You can request specific attributes of the dataset, like `description`, `citation`, and `homepage`, by calling them directly. Take a look at [`DatasetInfo`] for a complete list of attributes you can return.

```py
>>> dataset.split
NamedSplit('train')
>>> dataset.description
'GLUE, the General Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark\n(https://gluebenchmark.com/) is a collection of resources for training,\nevaluating, and analyzing natural language understanding systems.\n\n'
>>> dataset.citation
'@inproceedings{dolan2005automatically,\n  title={Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases},\n  author={Dolan, William B and Brockett, Chris},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing (IWP2005)},\n  year={2005}\n}\n@inproceedings{wang2019glue,\n  title={{GLUE}: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding},\n  author={Wang, Alex and Singh, Amanpreet and Michael, Julian and Hill, Felix and Levy, Omer and Bowman, Samuel R.},\n  note={In the Proceedings of ICLR.},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nNote that each GLUE dataset has its own citation. Please see the source to see\nthe correct citation for each contained dataset.'
>>> dataset.homepage

```

## Features and columns

A dataset is a table of rows and typed columns. Querying a dataset returns a Python dictionary where the keys correspond to column names, and the values correspond to column values:

```py
>>> dataset[0]
{'idx': 0,
'label': 1,
'sentence1': 'Amrozi accused his brother , whom he called " the witness " , of deliberately distorting his evidence .',
'sentence2': 'Referring to him as only " the witness " , Amrozi accused his brother of deliberately distorting his evidence .'}
```

Return the number of rows and columns with the following standard attributes:

```py
>>> dataset.shape
(3668, 4)
>>> dataset.num_columns
4
>>> dataset.num_rows
3668
>>> len(dataset)
3668
```

List the columns names with [`Dataset.column_names`]:

```py
>>> dataset.column_names
['idx', 'label', 'sentence1', 'sentence2']
```

Get detailed information about the columns with [`~datasets.Features`]:

```py
>>> dataset.features
{'idx': Value(dtype='int32', id=None),
    'label': ClassLabel(num_classes=2, names=['not_equivalent', 'equivalent'], names_file=None, id=None),
    'sentence1': Value(dtype='string', id=None),
    'sentence2': Value(dtype='string', id=None),
}
```

Return even more specific information about a feature like [`ClassLabel`], by calling its parameters `num_classes` and `names`:

```py
>>> dataset.features['label'].num_classes
2
>>> dataset.features['label'].names
['not_equivalent', 'equivalent']
```

## Rows, slices, batches, and columns

Get several rows of your dataset at a time with slice notation or a list of indices:

```py
>>> dataset[:3]
{'idx': [0, 1, 2],
    'label': [1, 0, 1],
    'sentence1': ['Amrozi accused his brother , whom he called " the witness " , of deliberately distorting his evidence .', "Yucaipa owned Dominick 's before selling the chain to Safeway in 1998 for $ 2.5 billion .", 'They had published an advertisement on the Internet on June 10 , offering the cargo for sale , he added .'],
    'sentence2': ['Referring to him as only " the witness " , Amrozi accused his brother of deliberately distorting his evidence .', "Yucaipa bought Dominick 's in 1995 for $ 693 million and sold it to Safeway for $ 1.8 billion in 1998 .", "On June 10 , the ship 's owners had published an advertisement on the Internet , offering the explosives for sale ."]
}
>>> dataset[[1, 3, 5]]
{'idx': [1, 3, 5],
    'label': [0, 0, 1], 
    'sentence1': ["Yucaipa owned Dominick 's before selling the chain to Safeway in 1998 for $ 2.5 billion .", 'Around 0335 GMT , Tab shares were up 19 cents , or 4.4 % , at A $ 4.56 , having earlier set a record high of A $ 4.57 .', 'Revenue in the first quarter of the year dropped 15 percent from the same period a year earlier .'],
    'sentence2': ["Yucaipa bought Dominick 's in 1995 for $ 693 million and sold it to Safeway for $ 1.8 billion in 1998 .", 'Tab shares jumped 20 cents , or 4.6 % , to set a record closing high at A $ 4.57 .', "With the scandal hanging over Stewart 's company , revenue the first quarter of the year dropped 15 percent from the same period a year earlier ."]
}
```

Querying by the column name will return its values. For example, if you want to only return the first three examples:

```py
>>> dataset['sentence1'][:3]
['Amrozi accused his brother , whom he called " the witness " , of deliberately distorting his evidence .', "Yucaipa owned Dominick 's before selling the chain to Safeway in 1998 for $ 2.5 billion .", 'They had published an advertisement on the Internet on June 10 , offering the cargo for sale , he added .']
```

Depending on how a [`Dataset`] object is queried, the format returned will be different:

- A single row like `dataset[0]` returns a Python dictionary of values.
- A batch like `dataset[5:10]` returns a Python dictionary of lists of values.
- A column like `dataset['sentence1']` returns a Python list of values.
