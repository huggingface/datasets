# Process image data

🤗 Datasets support loading and processing images with the [`Image`] feature. This guide will show you how to:

- Load an image dataset.
- Load a generic image dataset with `ImageFolder`.
- Use [`Dataset.map`] to quickly apply transforms to an entire dataset.
- Add data augmentations to your images with [`Dataset.set_transform`].

## Installation

The [`Image`] feature should be installed as an extra dependency in 🤗 Datasets. Install the [`Image`] feature (and its dependencies) with pip:

```bash
pip install datasets[vision]
```

## Image datasets

The images in an image dataset are typically either a:

- PIL `image`.
- Path to an image file you can load. 

For example, load the [Food-101](https://huggingface.co/datasets/food101) dataset and take a look:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image

>>> dataset = load_dataset("food101", split="train[:100]")
>>> dataset[0]
{'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=384x512 at 0x7FC45AB5C590>,
 'label': 6}
```

The [`Image`] feature automatically decodes the data from the `image` column to return an image object. Now try and call the `image` column to see what the image is:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image

>>> dataset = load_dataset("food101", split="train[100:200]")
>>> dataset[0]["image"]
```

To load an image from its path, use the [`Dataset.cast_column`] method. The [`Image`] feature will decode the data at the path to return an image object:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image

>>> dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"image": ["path/to/image_1", "path/to/image_2", ..., "path/to/image_n"]}).cast_column("image", Image())
>>> dataset[0]["image"]
```

You can also access the path and bytes of an image file by setting `decode=False` when you load a dataset. In this case, you will need to cast the `image` column:

```py
>>> dataset = load_dataset("food101", split="train[:100]").cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))
```

## ImageFolder

You can also load your image dataset with a `ImageFolder` dataset builder without writing a custom dataloader. Your image dataset structure should look like this:

```
folder/dog/golden_retriever.png
folder/dog/german_shepherd.png
folder/dog/chihuahua.png

folder/cat/maine_coon.png
folder/cat/bengal.png
folder/cat/birman.png
```

Then load your dataset by specifying `imagefolder` and the directory of your dataset in `data_dir`:

```py
>>> from datasets import load_dataset
>>> dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_dir="/path/to/folder")
```

Load remote datasets from their URLs with the `data_files` parameter:

```py
>>> dataset = load_dataset("imagefolder", data_files="https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/E/1/3E1C3F21-ECDB-4869-8368-6DEBA77B919F/kagglecatsanddogs_3367a.zip", split="train")
```

`ImageFolder` will create a `label` column, and the label name is based on the directory name.

<Tip>

If the image files come from a trusted source, pass `ignore_verifications=True` to [`load_dataset`] to skip checksum verification and speed up loading.

## Map

[`Dataset.map`] can apply transforms over an entire dataset and it also generates a cache file.

Create a simple [`Resize`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.transforms.Resize.html) function:

```py
>>> def transforms(examples):
...     examples["pixel_values"] = [image.convert("RGB").resize((100,100)) for image in examples["image"]]
...     return examples
```

Now [`Dataset.map`] the function over the entire dataset and set `batched=True`. The transform returns `pixel_values` as a cacheable `PIL.Image` object:

```py
>>> dataset = dataset.map(transforms, remove_columns=["image"], batched=True)
>>> dataset[0]
{'label': 6,
 'pixel_values': <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=100x100 at 0x7F058237BB10>}
```

This saves time because you don't have to execute the same transform twice. It is best to use [`Dataset.map`] for operations you only run once per training - like resizing an image - instead of using it for operations executed for each epoch, like data augmentations.

[`Dataset.map`] takes up some memory, but you can reduce its memory requirements with the following parameters:

- [`batch_size`](./package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict.map.batch_size) determines the number of examples that are processed in one call to the transform function.
- [`writer_batch_size`](./package_reference/main_classes#datasets.DatasetDict.map.writer_batch_size) determines the number of processed examples that are kept in memory before they are stored away.

Both parameter values default to 1000, which can be expensive if you are storing images. Lower the value to use less memory when calling [`Dataset.map`].

## Data augmentation

Adding data augmentations to a dataset is common to prevent overfitting and achieve better performance. You can use any library or package you want to apply the augmentations. This guide will use the transforms from [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html).

<Tip>

Feel free to use other data augmentation libraries like [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/). 🤗 Datasets can apply any custom function and transforms to an entire dataset!

</Tip>

Add the [`ColorJitter`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html#torchvision.transforms.ColorJitter) transform to change the color properties of the image randomly:

```py
>>> from torchvision.transforms import Compose, ColorJitter, ToTensor

>>> jitter = Compose(
...     [
...          ColorJitter(brightness=0.25, contrast=0.25, saturation=0.25, hue=0.7),
...          ToTensor(),
...     ]
... )
```

Create a function to apply the `ColorJitter` transform to an image:

```py
>>> def transforms(examples):
...     examples["pixel_values"] = [jitter(image.convert("RGB")) for image in examples["image"]]
...     return examples
```

Then you can use the [`Dataset.set_transform`] function to apply the transform on-the-fly to consume less disk space. Use this function if you only need to access the examples once:

```py
>>> dataset.set_transform(transforms)
```

Now visualize the results of the `ColorJitter` transform:

```py
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

>>> img = dataset[0]["pixel_values"]
>>> plt.imshow(img.permute(1, 2, 0))
```
