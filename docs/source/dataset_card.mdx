# Create a dataset card

Each dataset should have a dataset card to promote responsible usage and inform users of any potential biases within the dataset.
This idea was inspired by the Model Cards proposed by [Mitchell, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993).
Dataset cards help users understand a dataset's contents, the context for using the dataset, how it was created, and any other considerations a user should be aware of.

Creating a dataset card is easy and can be done in a just a few steps:

1. Go to your dataset repository on the [Hub](https://hf.co/new-dataset) and click on **Create Dataset Card** to create a new `README.md` file in your repository.

2. Use the **Metadata UI** to select the tags that describe your dataset. You can add a license, language, pretty_name, the task_categories, size_categories, and any other tags that you think are relevant. These tags help users discover and find your dataset on the Hub.

  <Tip>

  For a complete, but not required, set of tag options you can also look at the [Dataset Card specifications](https://github.com/huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/datasetcard.md?plain=1). This'll have a few more tag options like `multilinguality` and `language_creators` which are useful but not absolutely necessary.

  </Tip>

3. Click on the **Import dataset card template** link to automatically create a template with all the relevant fields to complete. Fill out the template sections to the best of your ability. Take a look at the [Dataset Card Creation Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md) for more detailed information about what to include in each section of the card. For fields you are unable to complete, you can write **[More Information Needed]**.

4. Once you're done, commit the changes to the `README.md` file and you'll see the completed dataset card on your repository.

Feel free to take a look at the [SNLI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli), [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail), and [Allocin√©](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allocine) dataset cards as examples to help you get started.
