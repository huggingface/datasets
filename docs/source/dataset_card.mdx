# Create a dataset card

Each dataset should have a dataset card to promote responsible usage and inform users of any potential biases within the dataset.
This idea was inspired by the Model Cards proposed by [Mitchell, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993).
Dataset cards help users understand a dataset's contents, the context for using the dataset, how it was created, and any other considerations a user should be aware of.

This guide shows you how to create a dataset card.

1. Create a new dataset card by copying this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/main/templates/README.md) to a `README.md` file in your repository.

2. Generate structured tags to help users discover your dataset on the Hub. Create the tags with the [online Datasets Tagging app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/datasets-tagging).

3. Select the appropriate tags for your dataset from the dropdown menus.

4. Copy the YAML tags under **Finalized tag set** and paste the tags at the top of your `README.md` file.

5. Fill out the dataset card sections to the best of your ability. Take a look at the [Dataset Card Creation Guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md) for more detailed information about what to include in each section of the card. For fields you are unable to complete, you can write **[More Information Needed]**.

6. Once you're done filling out the dataset card, commit the changes to the `README.md` file and you should see the completed dataset card on your repository.

Feel free to take a look at these dataset card examples to help you get started:

- [SNLI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli)
- [CNN / DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail)
- [Allociné](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allocine)

You can also check out the (similar) documentation about [dataset cards on the Hub side](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards).

## More YAML tags

You can use the `dataset_infos` YAML fields to define additional metadata for the dataset. Here is an example for SQuAD:

```YAML
pretty_name: SQuAD
language:
- en
...
dataset_infos:
  features:
  - name: id
    dtype: string
  - name: title
    dtype: string
  - name: context
    dtype: string
  - name: question
    dtype: string
  - name: answers
    sequence:
    - name: text
      dtype: string
    - name: answer_start
      dtype: int32
  splits:
  - name: train
    num_bytes: 79346360
    num_examples: 87599
  - name: validation
    num_bytes: 10473040
    num_examples: 10570
  download_size: 35142551
  dataset_size: 89819400
```

These metadata used to be included in the `dataset_infos.json` file, which is now deprecated.

### Feature types

Using the `features` field you can explicitly define the feature types of your dataset.
This is especially useful when type inference is not obvious.
For example if there's only one non-empty example in a 1TB dataset, the type inference is not able to infer the type of each column without going through the full dataset.
In this case, specifying the `features` field makes type inference much easier.

### Split sizes

Specifying the split sizes with `num_examples` enables TQDM bars (otherwise it doesn't know how many examples are left).
It also enables integrity verifications: if the dataset doesn't have the right number of `num_examples`, an error is returned.

Additionally you can add `num_bytes` to specify how big each split is.

### Dataset size

When [`load_dataset`] is called, it first downloads the dataset raw data files, and then it prepares the dataset in Arrow format.

You can specify how many bytes are required to download the raw data files with `dataset_size`, and use `dataset_size` for the size of the dataset in Arrow format.

### Multiple configurations

Certain datasets like `glue` have several configurations (`cola`, `sst2`, etc.) that can be loaded using `load_dataset("glue", "cola")` for example.

Each configuration can have different features, splits and sizes.
You can specify those fields per configuration using a YAML list:

```YAML
dataset_infos:
- config_name: cola
  features:
    ...
  splits:
    ...
  download_size: ...
  dataset_size: ...
- config_name: sst2
  features:
    ...
  splits:
    ...
  download_size: ...
  dataset_size: ...
```
