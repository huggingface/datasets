_DESCRIPTION = """
Recall is the fraction of the total amount of relevant examples that were actually retrieved. It can be computed with:
Precision = TP / (TP + FN)
TP: True positive
FN: False negative
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Args:
    predictions: Ground truth labels.
    references: Predicted labels, as returned by a model.
    labels: The set of labels to include when average != 'binary', and
        their order if average is None. Labels present in the data can
        be excluded, for example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring
        a majority negative class, while labels not present in the data will
        result in 0 components in a macro average. For multilabel targets,
        labels are column indices. By default, all labels in y_true and
        y_pred are used in sorted order.
    average: This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.
        If None, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise, this
        determines the type of averaging performed on the data:
            binary: Only report results for the class specified by pos_label.
                This is applicable only if targets (y_{true,pred}) are binary.
            micro: Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives,
                false negatives and false positives.
            macro: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean.
                This does not take label imbalance into account.
            weighted: Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average
                weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).
                This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance; it can result
                in an F-score that is not between precision and recall.
            samples: Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average
                (only meaningful for multilabel classification).
    sample_weight: Sample weights.
Returns:
    recall: Recall score.
