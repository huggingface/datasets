_DESCRIPTION = """
Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value for testing non-correlation.

The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship
between two datasets.  The calculation of the p-value relies on the
assumption that each dataset is normally distributed. Like other correlation
coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear relationship.
Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does y. Negative
correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases.

The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system
producing datasets that have a Pearson correlation at least as extreme
as the one computed from these datasets.

Args:
    predictions: Predicted labels, as returned by a model.

Returns:
    pearsonr: Pearson correlation coefficient.
Examples:

    >>> pearsonr_metric = datasets.load_metric("pearsonr")
    >>> results = pearsonr_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])
    >>> print(results)
