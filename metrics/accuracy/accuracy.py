_DESCRIPTION = """
Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases processed. It can be computed with:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
TP: True positive
TN: True negative
FP: False positive
FN: False negative
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Args:
    predictions: Ground truth labels.
    references: Predicted labels, as returned by a model.
    normalize: If False, return the number of correctly classified samples.
        Otherwise, return the fraction of correctly classified samples.
    sample_weight: Sample weights.
Returns:
    accuracy: Accuracy score.
