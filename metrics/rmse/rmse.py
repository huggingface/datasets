_DESCRIPTION = """\
Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) is the square root of the average of the square of difference between the predicted 
and actual values.
To compute RMSE, calculate the residual (difference between prediction and actual) for each data point, compute the norm of residual for each data point, 
compute the mean of residuals and take the square root of that mean. [Source : C3.ai]

Args:
    predictions: Estimated target values.
    references: Ground truth (correct) target values.
Returns:

Examples:

    >>> results = rmse_metric.compute(predictions=[2.5, 0.0, 2, 8], references=[3, -0.5, 2, 7])
