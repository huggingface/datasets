_DESCRIPTION = """\
ChrF and ChrF++ are two MT evaluation metrics. They both use the F-score statistic for character n-gram matches,
and ChrF++ adds word n-grams as well which correlates more strongly with direct assessment. We use the implementation
that is already present in sacrebleu.

The implementation here is slightly different from sacrebleu in terms of the required input format. The length of
the references and hypotheses lists need to be the same, so you may need to transpose your references compared to
sacrebleu's required input format. See https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/3154#issuecomment-950746534

See the README.md file at https://github.com/mjpost/sacreBLEU#chrf--chrf for more information.
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Produces ChrF(++) scores for hypotheses given reference translations.

Args:
    predictions: The system stream (a sequence of segments).
    references: A list of one or more reference streams (each a sequence of segments).
    char_order: Character n-gram order.
    word_order: Word n-gram order. If equals to 2, the metric is referred to as chrF++.
    beta: Determine the importance of recall w.r.t precision.
    lowercase: Enable case-insensitivity.
    whitespace: If `True`, include whitespaces when extracting character n-grams.
    eps_smoothing: If `True`, applies epsilon smoothing similar
    to reference chrF++.py, NLTK and Moses implementations. Otherwise,
    it takes into account effective match order similar to sacreBLEU < 2.0.0.

Returns:
    'score': The chrF (chrF++) score,
    'char_order': The character n-gram order,
    'word_order': The word n-gram order. If equals to 2, the metric is referred to as chrF++,
    'beta': Determine the importance of recall w.r.t precision

Examples:

    >>> prediction = ["The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly."]
    >>> reference = [["The ties between Obama and Netanyahu are not particularly friendly."]]
    >>> chrf = datasets.load_metric("chrf")
    >>> results = chrf.compute(predictions=prediction, references=reference)
    >>> print(results)
    {'score': 61.576379378113785, 'char_order': 6, 'word_order': 0, 'beta': 2}
