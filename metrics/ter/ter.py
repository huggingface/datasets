_DESCRIPTION = """\
TER (Translation Edit Rate, also called Translation Error Rate) is a metric to quantify the edit operations that a
hypothesis requires to match a reference translation. We use the implementation that is already present in sacrebleu
(https://github.com/mjpost/sacreBLEU#ter), which in turn is inspired by the TERCOM implementation, which can be found
here: https://github.com/jhclark/tercom.

The implementation here is slightly different from sacrebleu in terms of the required input format. The length of
the references and hypotheses lists need to be the same, so you may need to transpose your references compared to
sacrebleu's required input format. See https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/3154#issuecomment-950746534

See the README.md file at https://github.com/mjpost/sacreBLEU#ter for more information.
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Produces TER scores alongside the number of edits and reference length.

Args:
    predictions: The system stream (a sequence of segments).
    references: A list of one or more reference streams (each a sequence of segments).
    normalized: Whether to apply basic tokenization to sentences.
    no_punct: Whether to remove punctuations from sentences.
    asian_support: Whether to support Asian character processing.
    case_sensitive: Whether to disable lowercasing.

Returns:
    'score': TER score (num_edits / sum_ref_lengths * 100),
    'num_edits': The cumulative number of edits,
    'ref_length': The cumulative average reference length.

Examples:

    >>> predictions = ["hello there general kenobi", "foo bar foobar"]
    >>> references = [["hello there general kenobi", "hello there !"], ["foo bar foobar", "foo bar foobar"]]
    >>> ter = datasets.load_metric("ter")
    >>> results = ter.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
    >>> print(results)
    {'score': 0.0, 'num_edits': 0, 'ref_length': 6.5}
