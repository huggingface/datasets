_DESCRIPTION = """\
seqeval is a Python framework for sequence labeling evaluation.
seqeval can evaluate the performance of chunking tasks such as named-entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, semantic role labeling and so on.

This is well-tested by using the Perl script conlleval, which can be used for
measuring the performance of a system that has processed the CoNLL-2000 shared task data.

seqeval supports following formats:
IOB1
IOB2
IOE1
IOE2
IOBES

See the [README.md] file at https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval for more information.
"""

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Produces BLEU scores along with its sufficient statistics
from a source against one or more references.

Args:
    predictions: List of List of predicted labels (Estimated targets as returned by a tagger)
    references: List of List of reference labels (Ground truth (correct) target values)
Returns:
    'accuracy': accuracy,
    'precision': precision,
    'recall': recall,
    'f1': F1 score, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure,
