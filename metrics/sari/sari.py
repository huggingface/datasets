_DESCRIPTION = """\
SARI is a metric used for evaluating automatic text simplification systems.
The metric compares the predicted simplified sentences against the reference
and the source sentences. It explicitly measures the goodness of words that are
added, deleted and kept by the system.
Sari = (F1_add + F1_keep + P_del) / 3
where
F1_add: n-gram F1 score for add operation
F1_keep: n-gram F1 score for keep operation
P_del: n-gram precision score for delete operation
n = 4, as in the original paper.

This implementation is adapted from Tensorflow's tensor2tensor implementation [3].
It has two differences with the original GitHub [1] implementation:
  (1) Defines 0/0=1 instead of 0 to give higher scores for predictions that match
      a target exactly.
  (2) Fixes an alleged bug [2] in the keep score computation.

_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Calculates sari score (between 0 and 100) given a list of source and predicted
sentences, and a list of lists of reference sentences.
Args:
    sources: list of source sentences where each sentence should be a string.
    predictions: list of predicted sentences where each sentence should be a string.
    references: list of lists of reference sentences where each sentence should be a string.
Returns:
    sari: sari score
Examples:
    >>> sources=["About 95 species are currently accepted ."]
    >>> predictions=["About 95 you now get in ."]
    >>> references=[["About 95 species are currently known .","About 95 species are now accepted .","95 species are now accepted ."]]
    >>> sari = datasets.load_metric("sari")
