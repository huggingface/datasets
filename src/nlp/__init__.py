"""`nlp` defines a collection of datasets ready-to-use.

Each dataset is defined as a `nlp.DatasetBuilder`, which encapsulates
the logic to download the dataset and construct an input pipeline, as well as
contains the dataset documentation (version, splits, number of examples, etc.).

The main library entrypoints are:

* `nlp.load_dataset`: convenience method to construct a builder, download the data, and
    create an input pipeline, returning an NLP dataset.
