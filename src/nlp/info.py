""" DatasetInfo and MetricInfo record information we know about a dataset and a metric.

This includes things that we know about the dataset statically, i.e.:
 - description
 - canonical location
 - does it have validation and tests splits
 - size
 - etc.

This also includes the things that can and should be computed once we've
processed the dataset as well:
 - number of examples (in each split)
 - etc.
