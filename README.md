<p> Datasets and Metrics for Natural Language Processing in NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0
</h3>

ðŸ¤— `nlp` is a lightweight and extensible library to easily share and access datasets and evaluation metrics for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

`nlp` has many interesting features (beside easy share and access to datasets/metrics):

- Build-in interoperability with Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch and Tensorflow 2
- A small and fast library with a transparent and pythonic API
- Strive on large datasets: `nlp` naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped on drive by default.
- Smart caching with an intelligent tf.data-like cache: never wait for your data to process several times

`nlp` currently provides access to ~100 NLP datasets and ~10 metrics and let the community very easily add new datasets and metrics.

`nlp` originated from a fork of the awesome [`TensorFlow Datasets`](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the TensorFlow Datasets team behind this amazing library and user API.

# Installation

## From PyPI

`nlp` can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)

```bash
pip install nlp
```

## From source

You can also install `nlp` from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/nlp
cd nlp
pip install .
```

When you update the repository, you should upgrade the nlp installation and its dependencies as follows:

```bash
git pull
pip install --upgrade .
```

## Using with PyTorch/TensorFlow/pandas

If you plan to use `nlp` with PyTorch (1.0+), TensorFlow (2.2+) or pandas, you should also install the relevant framework.

# Usage

Using `nlp` is pretty simple:

```python
import nlp

# List all the available datasets
datasets = nlp.list_datasets()
print(dataset.id for dataset in datasets)

# Load a dataset
squad_dataset = nlp.load_dataset('squad')

# Print the first examples in the training set of SQuAD
squad_dataset['train'][0]
```

The best way to get a sense of `nlp` is to follow the tutorial in Google Colab which is here:
