ðŸ¤— Datasets is a lightweight library providing **two** main features:

- **one-line dataloaders for many public datasets**: one-liners to download and pre-process any of the ![number of datasets](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/datasets&color=brightgreen) major public datasets (image datasets, audio datasets, text datasets in 467 languages and dialects, etc.) provided on the [HuggingFace Datasets Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets). With a simple command like `squad_dataset = load_dataset("squad")`, get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),
- **efficient data pre-processing**: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV, JSON, text, PNG, JPEG, WAV, MP3, Parquet, etc. With simple commands like `processed_dataset = dataset.map(process_example)`, efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.

ðŸ¤— Datasets is designed to let the community easily add and share new datasets.

ðŸ¤— Datasets has many additional interesting features:

- Thrive on large datasets: ðŸ¤— Datasets naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped using an efficient zero-serialization cost backend (Apache Arrow).
- Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times.
- Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API (multi-processing/caching/memory-mapping).
- Built-in interoperability with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, Tensorflow 2 and JAX.
- Native support for audio and image data
- Enable streaming mode to save disk space and start iterating over the dataset immediately.

ðŸ¤— Datasets originated from a fork of the awesome [TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the TensorFlow Datasets team for building this amazing library. More details on the differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds` can be found in the section [Main differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds`](#main-differences-between--datasets-and-tfds).

# Installation

## With pip

ðŸ¤— Datasets can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)

```bash
pip install datasets
```

## With conda

ðŸ¤— Datasets can be installed using conda as follows:

```bash
conda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets
```

Follow the installation pages of TensorFlow and PyTorch to see how to install them with conda.

For more details on installation, check the installation page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation

## Installation to use with PyTorch/TensorFlow/pandas

If you plan to use ðŸ¤— Datasets with PyTorch (1.0+), TensorFlow (2.2+) or pandas, you should also install PyTorch, TensorFlow or pandas.

For more details on using the library with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch or TensorFlow, check the quick start page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart

# Usage

ðŸ¤— Datasets is made to be very simple to use - the API is centered around a single function, `datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, **kwargs)`, that instantiates a dataset.

This library can be used for text/image/audio/etc. datasets. Here is an example to load a text dataset:

Here is a quick example:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Print all the available datasets
from huggingface_hub import list_datasets
print([dataset.id for dataset in list_datasets()])

# Load a dataset and print the first example in the training set
squad_dataset = load_dataset('squad')
print(squad_dataset['train'][0])

# Process the dataset - add a column with the length of the context texts
dataset_with_length = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: {"length": len(x["context"])})

# Process the dataset - tokenize the context texts (using a tokenizer from the ðŸ¤— Transformers library)
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')

tokenized_dataset = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x['context']), batched=True)
```

If your dataset is bigger than your disk or if you don't want to wait to download the data, you can use streaming:

```python
# If you want to use the dataset immediately and efficiently stream the data as you iterate over the dataset
image_dataset = load_dataset('cifar100', streaming=True)
for example in image_dataset["train"]:
    break
```

# Add a new dataset to the Hub

We have a very detailed step-by-step guide to add a new dataset to the ![number of datasets](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/datasets&color=brightgreen) datasets already provided on the [HuggingFace Datasets Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).

You can find:
- [how to upload a dataset to the Hub using your web browser or Python](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/upload_dataset) and also
- [how to upload it using Git](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share).

# Main differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds`

If you are familiar with the great TensorFlow Datasets, here are the main differences between ðŸ¤— Datasets and `tfds`:

- the scripts in ðŸ¤— Datasets are not provided within the library but are queried, downloaded/cached and dynamically loaded upon request
- the backend serialization of ðŸ¤— Datasets is based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) instead of TF Records and leverage python dataclasses for info and features with some diverging features (we mostly don't do encoding and store the raw data as much as possible in the backend serialization cache).
- the user-facing dataset object of ðŸ¤— Datasets is not a `tf.data.Dataset` but a built-in framework-agnostic dataset class with methods inspired by what we like in `tf.data` (like a `map()` method). It basically wraps a memory-mapped Arrow table cache.

# Disclaimers

ðŸ¤— Datasets may run Python code defined by the dataset authors to parse certain data formats or structures. For security reasons, we ask users to:
- check the dataset scripts they're going to run beforehand and
- pin the `revision` of the repositories they use.

If you're a dataset owner and wish to update any part of it (description, citation, license, etc.), or do not want your dataset to be included in the Hugging Face Hub, please get in touch by opening a discussion or a pull request in the Community tab of the dataset page. Thanks for your contribution to the ML community!
