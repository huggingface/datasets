# How to add one (or several) new datasets to ðŸ¤— Datasets

## Start by preparing your environment

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page.
This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/datasets.git
	cd datasets
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.git
	```

3. Set up a development environment, for instance by running the following command:

	```bash
	conda create -n env python=3.7 --y
	pip install -e ".[dev]"
	```

Now you are ready, each time you want to add a new dataset, follow the steps in the following section:

## Start adding a new dataset

### Understand the structure of the dataset

1. Start by preparing the field and understanding how the dataset look like:

	- Find the research paper or description presenting the dataset you want to add (if there is an associated research paper)
	- Find the location of the data for you dataset
	- Read the relevant part of the paper or description presenting the dataset
	- Open the data to see how they look

2. Define the name of the dataset:

	- Select a `short name` for the dataset which is unique but not too long and is easy to guess for users, e.g. `squad`, `natural_questions`

	- Sometimes the short-list name is already given/proposed (e.g. in the spreadsheet of the data sprint to reach v2.0)

3. See if there is a need for several *configurations* and/or *splits* (usually at least splits will be defined).

	* Using several **configurations** allow to have like sub-datasets inside a dataset and are needed in two main cases:

		- The dataset covers or groups several sub-datasets or domains that the users may want to access independantly and/or
		- The dataset comprises several sub-parts with different features/organizations of the data (e.g. two types of CSV files with different types of columns). Inside a configuration of a dataset, all the data should have the same format (columns) but the columns can change accross configurations.

	* **Splits** are a more fine grained division than configurations. They allow you, inside a configuration of the dataset, to split the data in typically train/validation/test splits. All the splits inside a configuration should have the same columns/features: splits are defined for each specific configurations when there are multiple configurations.


You are now ready to start the process of adding the dataset. We will basically create the following files:

- **a dataset script**, e.g. `squad.py` which will contain the code to download and pre-process the dataset
- **a dataset card**, `README.md` which will contain general informations and tags related to the dataset

And automatically create the following additional meta-data files (using the CLI tools):

- **a metadata file** `dataset_infos.json` which will contain checksums and informations about the dataset to guarantee that the loading went fine.
- **a dummy-data file** `dummy_data.zip` which will contain small example original files to guarantee that the loading script is working well in the future.

4. Create a new branch to hold your development changes with the name of your dataset:

	```bash
	git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
	```

	**Do not** work on the `master` branch.

5. Create your dataset folder under `datasets/<your_dataset_name>`:

	```bash
	mkdir ./datasets/<your_dataset_name>
	```


### Write some code

Now let's get coding :-)

The dataset script is the main entry point to load and process the data. It is a python script under `datasets/<your_dataset_name>/<your_dataset_name>.py`.

There is a detailed explanation on how the library and scripts are organized [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/add_dataset.html).

Note on naming: the dataset class should be camel case, while the dataset short_name is its snake case equivalent (ex: `class BookCorpus(datasets.GeneratorBasedBuilder)` for the dataset `book_corpus`).

To add a new dataset, you can start from the empty template which is [in the `templates` folder](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/new_dataset_script.py):

```bash
cp ./templates/new_dataset_script.py ./datasets/<your_dataset_name>/<your_dataset_name>.py
```

And then go progressively through all the `TODO` in the template ðŸ™‚. If it's your first dataset addition and you are a bit lost among the information to fill in, you can take some time to read the [detailed explanation here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/add_dataset.html).

You can also start (or copy any part) from one of the datasets of reference listed below. The main criteria for choosing among these reference dataset is the format of the data files (JSON/JSONL/CSV/TSV/text) and whether you need or don't need several configurations (see above explanations on configurations). Feel free to reuse any parts of the following examples and adapt them to your case:

- question-answering: [squad](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/squad/squad.py) (original data are in json)
- natural language inference: [snli](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/snli/snli.py) (original data are in text files with tab separated columns)
- POS/NER: [conll2003](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/conll2003/conll2003.py) (original data are in text files with one token per line)
- sentiment analysis: [allocine](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/allocine/allocine.py) (original data are in jsonl files)
- text classification: [ag_news](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/ag_news/ag_news.py) (original data are in csv files)
- translation: [flores](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/flores/flores.py) (original data come from text files - one per language)
- summarization: [billsum](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/billsum/billsum.py) (original data are in json files)
- benchmark: [glue](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/glue/glue.py) (original data are various formats)
- multilingual: [xquad](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/xquad/xquad.py) (original data are in json)
- multitask: [matinf](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/datasets/xquad/xquad.py) (original data need to be downloaded by the user because it requires authentificaition)

While you are developping the dataset script you can list test it by opening a python interpreter and running the script:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset('./datasets/<your_dataset_name>')
```

This let you use `print()` statements as well as seeing directly errors and the final dataset format.

**Important rules to follow**:

- try to give access to all the data, columns, features and information in the dataset. If the dataset contains various sub-parts with differing formats, create several configurations to give access to all of them.
- datasets in the `datasets` library are typed. Take some time to carefully think about the `features` (see an introduction [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/exploring.html#features-and-columns) and the full list of possible features [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/features.html))
- if some of you dataset features are in a fixed set of classes (e.g. labels), you should use a `ClassLabel` feature.

### Automatically add code metadata

Now that your dataset script runs and create a dataset with the format you expected.

1. **Make sure you run all of the following commands from the root of your git cloned `datasets`.** To check that your dataset works correctly and to create its `dataset_infos.json` file run the command:

	```bash
	python datasets-cli test datasets/<your-dataset-folder> --save_infos --all_configs
	```

	This first command should create a `dataset_infos.json` file in your dataset folder.



2. If this command was succesful, you can now create the dummy data. There is a tool that automatically generates dummy data for you. At the moment it supports data files in the following format: txt, csv, tsv, jsonl, json, xml.
If the extensions of the raw data files of your dataset are in this list, then you can automatically generate your dummy data with:

	```bash
 	python datasets-cli dummy_data datasets/<your-dataset-folder> --auto_generate
	```

	Example:

	```bash
 	python datasets-cli dummy_data ./datasets/snli --auto_generate
	```

	If this doesn't work more information on how to add dummy data can be found in the documentation [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share_dataset.html#adding-dummy-data).

2. Now test that both the real data and the dummy data work correctly using the following commands:

	*For the real data*:
	```bash
	RUN_SLOW=1 pytest tests/test_dataset_common.py::LocalDatasetTest::test_load_real_dataset_<your-dataset-name>
	```
	and

	*For the dummy data*:
	```bash
	RUN_SLOW=1 pytest tests/test_dataset_common.py::LocalDatasetTest::test_load_dataset_all_configs_<your-dataset-name>
	```

3. If all tests pass, your dataset works correctly. Awesome!

### Manually tag the dataset and write the dataset card

Each dataset will be provided with a dataset card.

The dataset card is **really important**  to make sure the dataset can be found on the hub and will be used by the users. Users need to have the best possible idea of what's inside the dataset and how it was created so that they can use it safely and have a good idea of its limitations.

Creating the dataset card goes in two steps:

1. **Tagging the dataset using the tagging streamlit app**

	Clone locally the dataset-tagging app which is [here](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets-tagging).

	Run the app with the command detailed in the [Readme](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets-tagging/blob/main/README.md)

	Then you can fill the different tags for your dataset ;)

2. **Copy the tags in the dataset card and complete the dataset card**

	Copy the [template dataset card](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README.md) in your dataset folder:
	```bash
	cp ./templates/README.md ./datasets/<your_dataset_name>/README.md
	```

	Weâ€™re using YAML for tags actually, not JSON (even though the datasets-tagging tool allows to save in JSON). On the right side of the app there is an option to "Show YAML output".  Once you've tagged and saved all of the configs, you can copy-paste the output of this field at the top of your README.

	Complete the dataset card using the detailed instructions which can be found in the `README_guide.md` [here](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/master/templates/README_guide.md).

	Here are a couple of completed examples for inspiration: the [CoNLL-2002 NER task](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/tree/master/datasets/conll2002) and the [ELI5: Long Form Question Answering dataset](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/tree/master/datasets/eli5).

	If you don't know what to write in a field or can't find it, write: `[More Information Needed]`

Once your `README.md` is complete you have finished all the steps to add your dataset, congratulation you are amazing ðŸŽ‰

You can now push your dataset on the main repo:

### Push the new dataset on the main repo

1. Format your code. Run black, isort and flake8 so that your newly added files look nice with the following commands:

	```bash
	make style
	flake8 datasets
	```

2. Once you're happy with your dataset script file, add your changes and make a commit to record your changes locally:

	```bash
	git add datasets/<your_dataset_name>
	git commit
	```

	It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original
	repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:

	```bash
	git fetch upstream
	git rebase upstream/master
    ```

   Push the changes to your account using:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes
   ```

3. Once you are satisfied, go the webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on "Pull request" to send your to the project maintainers for review.
